         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE antient Fervor of Chriſtian Charity being grown cold, which not only moved Princes,<note place="margin">N. 1.</note> and private Perſons to give temporal Riches plentifully to the Churches; but alſo induced the Miniſters of the Church to beſtow them holily on pious occaſions,<note place="margin">N. 2.</note> it is no wonder if at preſent faithful Stewards ſeem to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and others diligent only in gaining and retaining have ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their ſtead, ſo that it hath been neceſſary to moderate by Laws the exceſſive gaines, and a continual deſire is kindled in godly men to ſee the Adminiſtration of the goods poſſeſſed by the Churches once more reſtored, if not to that antient Exemplarineſs, at leaſt to a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Moderation.</p>
            <p>The Defects which appear to us in theſe dayes, entered not into the Clerical order all together, neither grew they ſo Ecceſſive at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of time; but from a ſupream, or rather from a divine Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they deſcended by degrees unto Imperfection, which is now mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt unto all, and confeſſed by the Clergy it ſelf, and by ſome eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed irremediable: Notwithſtanding that if it pleaſed God our Lord to give unto his faithful as much grace as he gave to our forefathers, we ſhould not looſe the hope of ſeeing the ſame wonders yet in our Age: It is indeed neceſſary that as by Degrees we came to this depth of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, ſo by Degrees we may aſcend towards that height of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in which the Holy Church was. The which cannot be done,<note place="margin">N. 3.</note> but by knowing what was the <hi>Administration of temporal things</hi> from the Beginning, and how this good Government came to fail, it is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly neceſſary before all things, to tell how the Church from time to time acquired temporal Riches, and how upon each alteration it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60809:6"/>Miniſters to beſtow, or to poſſeſs them, which will diſcover to us the hindrances which in theſe times prevent a good Reformation, and will ſhew how to overcome them; and this is my Deſign in the preſent Diſcourſe ſo ample concerning beneficial matter.</p>
            <p>The beginning of Eccleſiaſtical Benefices was whilſt our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Converſed in this world, and their <hi>Stock</hi> was nothing elſe but the <hi>Oblations of Pious and devout Perſons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 4.</note> which were kept by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and diſtributed for two works only; one for the <hi>Neceſſities of our Lord,</hi> and of the <hi>Apostles preachers</hi> of the Goſpel; and the other for <hi>Almes to the Poor.</hi> All this is clearly ſeen in St. <hi>John,</hi> where the Evangeliſt ſayes that <hi>Judas</hi> was he who bore the <hi>Purſe,</hi> wherein was put the Money preſented to our Lord, he ſpending the ſame, and buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things neceſſary for them, or elſe diſtributing to the Poor accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what our Lord commanded for the day. St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that Chriſt having the Attendance of Angels who Miniſtred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, was in no neceſſity of keeping or preſerving of Money: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs he would have a Purſe, to give an example to the Church of what ſhe ought to do, and therefore the <hi>Church</hi> alwayes underſtood that from his Divine Holyneſs by his own Example the Form of the Eccleſiaſtical Money might be inſtituted,<note place="margin">N. 5.</note> inſtructing from whence it ſhould be taken, and wherein it ſhould be laid out. And if in our dayes we ſee not this holy inſtitution obſerved, we ought to conſider that for our inſtruction, and for our conſolation the Divine Scripture relates, that then <hi>Judas</hi> alſo was a <hi>Thief,</hi> and uſurped to himſelf the goods common to the <hi>Apostolical Colledge,</hi> and came to ſuch a Height of Covetouſneſs, that what he ſtole ſeeming not ſufficient for him, he proceeded ſo far in wickedneſs, that he ſold to the <hi>Jews</hi> the very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt our Lord, to make his ſumm of Money greater. And if we either in reading Hiſtories, or elſe in obſerving things occurrent in our Times, we ſhall believe that Eccleſiaſtical Goods are in a great Part ſpent in other uſes than Pious, and that ſome of the Miniſters not content of uſurping to themſelves that which ought to be in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the Church, and to the Poor, have gone ſo far as to <hi>ſell Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred things and Spiritual Graces to make Money,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 6.</note> we ought not to refer this to a Particular Miſery of our or of any other times; but to aſcribe it to the Divine Permiſſion for the Exerciſe of the Good, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Beginning of the <hi>Infant Church</hi> was ſubject to the ſame Imperfections: Indeed we ought every one according to his Degree and Vocation to procure a Remedy, and he that cannot do otherwiſe by his Prayers, and he that can hinder the Evil by preventing and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Abuſes, conſidering that although <hi>Judas</hi> had no humane Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, becauſe thoſe who ought to have puniſhed him were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices in his Offence, nevertheleſs divine Providence ſhewed what Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty he deſerved, and appointed that he ſhould be his own Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, for a Document of what thoſe ought to do, who are given for <hi>Tutors</hi> and <hi>Defenders</hi> of the Church in following Ages.</p>
            <p>After Chriſt our Lord had aſcended into Heaven, the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles followed in the Church of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> the ſame Inſtitution of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church money for the two Effects aboveſaid,<note place="margin">N. 7.</note> that is, for the <hi>Need of the Ministers of the Goſpel,</hi> and for <hi>Almes to the Poor:</hi> and the Stock of this money was likewiſe the <hi>Oblations of the Faithful,</hi> who alſo making all their Goods common, ſold their Poſſeſſions to make money for this uſe: <hi>So that the Community of the Church was not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60809:6"/>from the Particular of each faithful Man,</hi> as is practized ſtill in ſome Religions which obſerve thoſe firſt Inſtitutions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in thoſe primitive Times were very ready to ſtrip themſelves of their Temporal Goods, to beſtow them in Almes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they looked for the end of the World to be at hand, Chriſt our Lord having left it to them uncertain, and although it was to laſt as long as he pleaſed, they conſidered it no otherwiſe but as being to end then, holding for certain that the Figure of this World, that is, the State of this preſent Life paſſeth away; wherefore the <hi>Oblations</hi> encreaſed alwayes the more; yet the <hi>Custom</hi> of not having any thing of ones own, but all things in Common,<note place="margin">N. 8.</note> ſo that there was neither poor nor rich, but all lived equally, <hi>went not out of Hieruſalem;</hi> For in the other Churches which the Holy Apoſtles planted, it was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, neither did it laſt long in <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon 26 <hi>years after</hi> the Death of Chriſt it is read that the publick was diſtinct from the private, every one knowing his own, but the money being common in that Church as in others <hi>founded in Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> which placed in Common, ſerved for the <hi>Ministers</hi> only and for the <hi>Poor,</hi> and it was not Lawful for him, who had wherewithal of his own, to live upon the Churches Stock; whereupon St. <hi>Paul</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that Widdows who had Kindred ſhould be relieved by their Relations, that the Church Goods might be ſufficient for thoſe who are widdows indeed, that is, Widdows and poor.</p>

               <hi>The firſt day of the week which for</hi> that cauſe <hi>was called the Lords day,</hi> the Faithful met together,<note place="margin">N. 9.</note> and each one offered that which he had ſet apart of the foregoing week for the <hi>Neceſſities of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>

            <p>The care of theſe Goods which our Lord whilſt he was in this Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Life gave unto <hi>Judas,</hi> was adminiſtred by the Apoſtles themſelves for a ſhort Time after the Aſcenſion, but afterwards perceiving that Murmurings and Seditions did ariſe amongſt the Faithful, about the Diſtributions that were made, it appearing to ſome that they were not ſo great Sharers of the Common, as they willingly would have been, and believing that others had more than they ought, ſo as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Evil in all Times in diſpenſing the Goods of the Church, <hi>the Apostles knew</hi> they could not <hi>attend this perfectly, together</hi> with <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word of God,</hi> they determined to retain to themſelves the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of <hi>Preaching</hi> and teaching, appointing for this Office of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing care of Temporal things, another ſort of Miniſters quite different <hi>from that which</hi> we ſee done in our Times, <hi>wherein the chief Prelates of the Church attend the Government of Temporal things,</hi>

            <p>But theſe new Miniſters which the holy Apoſtles inſtituted for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Temporal things were called <hi>Deacons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deacons.</note> for which purpoſe Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was made of ſix from all the <hi>Body of the Faithful,</hi> which the Apoſtles appointed for that Miniſtry, and whereſoever they founded a Church, they alſo appointed <hi>Deacons</hi> in the ſame Manner, as alſo they ordained <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi> and other Eccleſiaſtical Miniſters, Faſting and Prayer preceeding, and the <hi>Common Election</hi> of the <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful following after,</hi> Obſerving inviolably this order of never deputing any man to any Eccleſiaſtical Charge, who was not <hi>first elected by the

            <p>This <hi>Cuſtome</hi> continued in the Church in ſuch a Manner for about 200 <hi>years,</hi>

            <p>After the Churches were enriched, the Clerks alſo began to live more at eaſe, and ſome not being content with the ordinary daily food of the Church, would live ſeparately in their own Houſes, and receive from the Church their ſeparate proportion in Money every Day, or for a Month together and longer; a thing which although it declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Primitive Perfection,<note place="margin">N. 14.</note> was nevertheleſs tolerated by the Fathers.

               <note place="margin">N. 19.</note> for it proved not dammage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Publick, nor burdenſom to the Commonalty for two Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, one, becauſe Eccleſiaſtical Goods were finally the Poors of the People, and exempting thoſe who had not, and leaving the Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to thoſe who had wherewithal, was alwayes accounted juſt; the other, becauſe Exempting a man when he hath little, and leſs than what ſufficeth, is no Burden unto others. Nevertheleſs <hi>no man ſhould infer</hi> that the ſame liberality of Princes towards the Church, would be juſt and Convenient in theſe times alſo when it is grown ſo Rich, that it poſſeſſeth a quarter, and without doubt more than what the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Perſons, and this is not <hi>laid out any longer for the Poor;</hi> ſo that to Exempt them would be contrary to what good Princes have done, in Exempting the Rich, and in laying their due burdens on the Poor. Wherefore the Princes at preſent are no leſs pious than thoſe then, but the <hi>Subject is different:</hi> For theſe would alſo grant Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Church if it were poor, and thoſe would not have grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, if it had been Rich.</p>
            <p>The great Devotion of Princes and of the People, as it cauſed the Wealth of the Clergy to encreaſe abundantly, ſo it excited a great Thirſt in the Eccleſiaſtical Miniſters, to Multiply it or heap it up; from which exceſs not ſo much as the wel-minded men were free; for ſeeing how the Diſtribution of Eccleſiaſtical Goods fell to the Glory of God,<note place="margin">N. 20.</note> and to the Common Good, they concluded that the more the Church had to Diſtribute, the better it was, whereupon they made uſe of all Wayes and of all Arts to gain Wealth, <hi>not conſidering whether the Means they uſed were Lawful and ſuitable unto Equity;</hi> ſo that if the Effect did but enſue, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Church might gain by any means whatſoever, She ſeemed to have made a Sacrifice unto God: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly immenſe and innumerable Evils proceed from this ſort of Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Perſons, who do not uſe Diſcretion with their Zeal, becauſe it ſeeming to them that every thing ſent for A Religious End by what way ſoever to be Good, they oftentimes Act againſt Piety and againſt Humanity, putting the World into a confuſion; thus it happened in the Primitive times, that the Church obtained Power to acquire real Eſtates, it was <hi>believed by ſome Religious Men,</hi> to be a <hi>Service of God to deprive</hi> their own Children and Kindred, to give to the Churches, for which cauſe alſo they Omitted no Art to induce Widdows, Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,<note place="margin">N. 21.</note> and other eaſie Perſons to deprive their own Families, to leave to the Church: The Diſorder paſſed ſo ſpeedily the Bounds of being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, that the Prince was neceſſitated to provide againſt it, and in the year 370,<note place="margin">Statute of <hi>Mortmain.

                  <hi>A<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.</hi> 390.</note> another Law was made, <hi>that a Widdow who devoted her ſelf</hi> to the ſervice of the Church, could not give or leave to it by will

            </p>
            <p>This Exceſs of getting was not very pleaſing to St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 22.</note> who lived in thoſe dayes, for he openly declared, that it pleaſed him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Inheritances ſhould be left to the next of Kin, than to the Church, and indeed he refuſed ſome Inheritances left unto his Church, ſaying openly, the Eccleſiaſtical Miniſtry conſiſted <hi>not in Diſtributing much, but in Diſtributing well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Likewiſe he reproved a new way the Church had of purchaſing found out in thoſe dayes, which was buying real Eſtates with the Advance made upon the <hi>Incomes or Rent, which way that Holy man alwaies ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred,</hi> neither would he ever permit it in his Church, for he declared in his publick Sermons, that he had rather live upon the Oblations and Collections which were wont to be made in the Primitive times of the Church, than to have a Care of Poſſeſſions, which were <hi>burdenſome</hi> to him, and hindered him from attending <hi>intirely</hi> upon the Principal Charge of a Biſhop, that is, of Spiritual things; adding further, that he was prepared to renounce all Poſſeſſions,<note place="margin">N. 23.</note> if a livelihood were provided for the Servants of God, and Miniſters, as in the old Teſtament, by way of Tythes or of other Oblations, without being ſubject to the <hi>Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> which the Care of Earthly things brought along with it.</p>
            <p>But for all the Checks of the Holy Fathers through their good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, and of the Princes by their good Laws, the Eccleſiaſtical Goods could not be hindered from encreaſing above what they ought only the ancient manner of Governing and of beſtowing them remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and laſted till the year 420, without any notable Alteration; Beſides all the Oblations and other Eccleſiaſtical Incomes proceeding from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Eſtates were in Common, and governed by the <hi>Deacons</hi> by the <hi>Sub-Deacons,</hi> and by other Stewards their Aſſiſtants, and Diſtributed for the Maintenance of the <hi>Eccleſiastical Miniſters</hi> and <hi>of the Poor;</hi> the Colledge of Prieſts and the Biſhop were principally the Intendants, and in ſhort an Account of all Receits and Disburſments was kept, ſo that the <hi>Biſhop Diſpoſed of every thing,</hi> the <hi>Deacons Executed it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 24.</note> and all the Clergy lived upon what the Church had, although all did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter.

            <p>I know that ſome do attribute this Diviſion to Pope <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> who was 150 years before, grounded upon ſome feigned Scriptures after, with little Honour to that Age, which was not then much Polluted.</p>

            <p>The Princes alſo ſaw evidently how great Impediments were brought againſt the Quietneſs of the State, and againſt the good Government of the Common-wealth, by the <hi>Private Interests of the Ambitious Clergy,</hi> and by the Seditious Practices, which they uſed to acquire Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Dignities; whereupon, partly out of Divine Reſpect, and partly for Human, they began to prevent the Clergy and the Laity from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding themſelves after their way according to their Affections, as well becauſe Affairs being altered and the Biſhoprick no more ſhun'd, but coveted, they made Parties, from whence proceeded Seditions, and ſometimes popular Slaughters by means of the Concurrents, as alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſometimes Factious Perſons were choſen for Biſhops, who held pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intelligence with the Princes Enemies, which were never wanting in the Weſtern Confuſions,<note place="margin">N. 34.</note> and ſometimes Perſons were choſen, who having gained a Train of People, Attempted ſome Deſign to <hi>Attribute the Juriſdiction of the Magiſtrate to themſelves,</hi> and would ſtir up the People to Defend their Enterpriſes; whereupon, the Princes Ordained that no Perſon Elected, ſhould be Conſecrated without their Conſent or the Magiſtrates, the <hi>Prince</hi> Reſerving to himſelf the <hi>Confirmation of the great Biſhopricks,</hi> as in <hi>Italy</hi> of <hi>Rome, Ravenna,</hi> and of <hi>Milan,</hi> leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leſſer Biſhopricks to the Care of the Miniſters; But taking more heed to the Subſtance of the thing, than to the Appearance, when in a City there was an <hi>Eminent Subject known to the People,</hi> to whom all were enclined,<note place="margin">☞</note> and the Prince ſatisfied that he pleaſed the People,<note place="margin">Occurrenza.</note> when an Occurrence came, <hi>he was Conſecrated without more ado:</hi> Sometimes alſo there happened through Accident of War, or of Plague, that one had been Ordained, before he had the Confirmation of the Prince,<note place="margin">N. 35.</note> as happen'd to <hi>Pelagius</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> Predeceſſor to St. <hi>Gregory; Rome</hi> being Beſieged by the <hi>Lombards,</hi> after the Siege was raiſed, he ſent <hi>Gregory,</hi> who was then <hi>Deacon,</hi> to make Excuſe to the Emperor, beſeeching him to Confirm what Neceſſity had Conſtrained him to do.

                  <hi>A<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.</hi> 750.</note> with the Imperial Confirmation; but in <hi>France,</hi> and in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces beyond the Alps, the Regal or the Princes Authority was herein more abſolute, <hi>for the People totally deſisted from the Election,</hi> when
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60809:10"/>the Prince took it in Hand; good men forbore, becauſe believing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be well provided with Kings, eſteemed their Interventions Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous; evil men, becauſe they were not certain of being able to bring their Deſigns to paſs; whereupon the Kings gave the Biſhopricks to them only throughout the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>In all <hi>Gregory Turonenſis'</hi> Hiſtory from <hi>Clodovius,</hi> the firſt Chriſtian King of <hi>France,</hi> unto the year 590, no Biſhop was known to be made but by the Command or by the Conſent of the King,<note place="margin">N. 36.</note> and St. <hi>Gregory who was made Pope that year,</hi> writing to the Kings of <hi>France</hi> upon different occaſions, Complains to them that the Biſhopricks were not beſtowed on ſufficient men, and prayes them to make choice of good and underſtanding men. He never reprehends the Proviſion made by the Kings, when the Perſon provided was deſerving.</p>
            <p>As for Biſhops who were choſen without the Authority of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it was eaſie to exclude them alſo from the Election of Prieſts, Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, and other Eccleſiaſtical Miniſters, reducing the Power of nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating them to the Prince only, without the Intervention of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, part of them having withdrawn themſelves totally from meddling in Eccleſiaſtical Congregations, to attend their Domeſtick Affairs, others through the Inconveniencies which did ariſe amongſt popular Factions, and ſome others for ſeeing themſelves diſreſpected by the Biſhop grown Potent, as well by the Riches he had to ſpend, as by his Dependance on the Prince, by whom he was Nominated to, or Confirmed in the Biſhoprick.</p>
            <p>The Prince ſometimes Nominated thoſe that were to be Ordained,<note place="margin">N. 37.</note> at other times he left the Care wholly to the Biſhop, chiefly when he was fully Conſident, which Conſidence was alſo Cauſe that the Prince oftentimes made uſe of the Biſhop, either to compoſe Difficalties amongſt the People, or to determine Difficult Cauſes, <hi>the Reſpect of Religion being the Cauſe,</hi> that they were more believed than the Magiſtrates; whereupon they were more intent upon that, than in teaching the <hi>Christian Doctrine, which at first was given them in Charge;</hi> Therefore when making of a Biſhop was in Queſtion, it behooved rather to have Reſpect unto a wiſe Word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, than unto <hi>one understanding in Matters of Faith,</hi> which remains ſtill unto this time, it being ſaid, that excepting the Places bordering on the Inſidells, it is better making a Biſhop of a good <hi>Juriſconſult or Lawyer,</hi> than of a <hi>good Divine;</hi> and truly 'tis a reaſonable thing, if the <hi>Principall Office</hi> of a Biſhop were to judge Cauſes.<note place="margin">N. 38.</note> Chriſt our Lord Ordaining his Apoſtles, ſaid, <hi>as my Father hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you,</hi> by which they underſtood to be ſent to <hi>Teach:</hi> If now all be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently inſtructed, and there be no more need of it, he may attend ſomewhat elſe: Heretofore the Principal Care of the Biſhop was to <hi>Teach,</hi> and the next to overſee the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Poor;</hi> ſo that in the ſecond, as well as in the firſt, there was ſome Relaxation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in making the Diviſion <hi>into four parts</hi> abovementioned, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Goods being in the Hands of the Clergy, and thoſe were they who divided after their way, ſo that where the Biſhop and the Prieſts were Conſcionable men, the Diviſion was Juſtly made; But where they did not forget themſelves (there being none to Protect the Poor, and as few to take Care of the Buildings) the Shares of theſe two were very ſmall, and in ſome places nothing belonged to either of them, but all was Divided between the Biſhop and the Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60809:11"/>
            <p>Beſides alſo, where the Diviſion was made with due Proportion, nevertheleſs the Adminiſtration of the Buildings,<note place="margin">N. 39.</note> and the Shares of the Poor remaining in the Hands of the Clergy, they came to diminiſh by little and little, and the other two waxed greater; which evidently appears, for that in very few places the Buildings have any proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and for the Poor there remained nothing but the <hi>Hoſpitals,</hi> which are of no <hi>Antient Institution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Beginning the Share of the Clergy was not Divided amongſt them, but the Biſhop had a Care of dealing with each one according to his Merits, but afterwards they took upon themſelves the Office of Dividing, the Biſhop being Excluded, and they having their Share, where neither Biſhop nor others had to do, they Divided again amongſt themſelves, ſo that each Particular man began to know his own, and <hi>ceaſed from living in Common.</hi> But although the Rents or Incomes were thus Divided, nevertheleſs all the Stocks or Eſtates remained in one Body, Governed by the <hi>Deacons</hi> and <hi>Sub-Deacons,</hi> and the Rents pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from thence Conſigned to the Biſhop, and to each one of the Clergy, according to the Proportion of their Shares.</p>
            <p>And in <hi>Italy</hi> in thoſe times the Poſſeſſions of the Church were called <hi>Patrimonies,</hi>

            <p>The Churches placed in Cities,<note place="margin">N. 41.</note> whoſe Inhabitants were of but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Fortunes, had no Poſſeſſions left to them out of their Diſtrict. But to thoſe of <hi>Imperial Cities,</hi> as <hi>Rome, Ravenna, Milan,</hi> where Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators and other Illuſtrious Perſons dwelt, Poſſeſſions were left in divers parts of the World. St. <hi>Gregory</hi> makes mention of the Church of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna</hi>'s Patrimony in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and of another there belonging to the Church of <hi>Milan;</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had <hi>Patrimonies in moſt parts of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mention is made of the <hi>Patrimony</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> of <hi>Africk,</hi> of <hi>Sicily,</hi> of the <hi>Cottian Alps,</hi> and of many others; but in the time of the ſaid St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> there was a Difference, or ſuit at Law, between him and the Biſhop of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> for the <hi>Patrimonies</hi> of both Churches, which was accommodated by <hi>Tranſaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To gain alſo greater Reſpect for the Poſſeſſions of the Church, they were wont to give it <hi>the name of Holy,</hi> which that Church had in great Veneration; So the Church of <hi>Ravenna</hi> Nominated her Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of St. <hi>Apollinare,</hi>

            <p>From the Beginning until a little before the year 500,<note place="margin">N. 54.</note> as hath been ſaid, every Clerk was Ordained unto ſome Office, and <hi>lived upon the common Maintenance,</hi>

            <p>The Epiſcopal order hath been no leſs exempt from this Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, but biſhops have been Ordained with a Title only, or with a name of Deriſion, hold nothing; yet they are not vulgarly ſo treated or ſtyled, as other unbenefic'd Clerks; for though indeed they Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prieſts,<note place="margin">N. 56.</note> Deacons, and other inferior Miniſters without Charge ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in fact, or in name; yet 'twas never uſual until now to Ordain a Biſhop without a Dioceſs from whence he was denominated, wherefore if a City were aſſigned him poſſeſſed at preſent by Infidels from whence
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60809:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>he takes his name, and no Chriſtians being there, the Biſhop ordained remains with a Name only without People, and lives by ſerving ſome great Biſhop who cannot, or accounts it a thing inferiour to him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe by himſelf the Epiſcopal Functions.</p>
            <p>There was a great number of ſuch <hi>Titular Biſhops</hi> before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent,</hi> now 'tis much leſſened.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the Jeſuit Fathers at preſent propoſe a queſtion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope can ordain Biſhops without any Title, either true or feigned, as Prieſts and Deacons are ordained, and they decide that he may: God grant that this Power may not be put in practice, leſt the Reverence to that Order ſhould be loſt,<note place="margin">N. 57.</note> which heretofore was great towards all Eccleſiaſtical Orders when none was ordained, but he that was appointed to an Office, as hath been ſaid, for which cauſe all of them <hi>reſided or dwelt upon their Charge,</hi> which could not be left vacant,<note place="margin">Reſidence and Non-reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> there being none to ſupply it, all being occupied in their own: in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the diſtinction of Benefices was unknown, which ſought for Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and ſought it not; and whether the Benefice were rich or poor, either of a heavy or of a light burthen, it behooved that the Poſſeſſor ſhould ſerve it perſonally.</p>
            <p>But after they began to ordain without Title, the Titulars having who to put in their room, the charge was left to one with ſome ſmall Proviſions for attending, and they attended on ſomewhat elſe. So in <hi>France,</hi> the Biſhops ſerved the Court and the Pariſhes alſo, ſomo poor Prieſt being ſubſtituted.</p>
            <p>They began to provide againſt the Diſorder, not with Laws and Conſtitutions, but by puniſhments of Cenſures, and of Privations; ſo that in the times whereof we ſpeak,<note place="margin">N. 58.</note> that is immediately before the year 800. they were refrained by theſe chaſtiſements, but ſo that the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Benefices, as alſo the Ordination of non-Titulars, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions for the Reſidency did not paſs without ſome diverſity between place and place; even in the ſame Church it paſſed not without ſome variation, cauſed indeed by the different minds of the Biſhops who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded one another; as alſo through divers Proviſions made from time to time by Princes, to prevent the diſorders cauſed by the willing of too much in ſome Clergy-man,<note place="margin">Troppo vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lere.</note> or by the impatience of ſome popular man, who could not ſee himſelf totally excluded from Eccleſiaſtical affairs.</p>
            <p>Much Alteration happened unto <hi>Charlemain,</hi> who having reduced under his obedience <hi>Italy, France,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> reformed alſo the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical affairs, reducing them to an Uniformity, which in divers places had been differently inſtituted, renewing many of the old Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and Councels, worn out of uſe,<note place="margin">N. 59.</note> and making of Eccleſiaſtical Laws for the diſtribution of Benefices according to the Exigencies of thoſe Times, he partly reſtored unto the Pariſhes the Poſſeſſions which the <hi>Biſhops</hi> had drawn to themſelves, ordaining that every <hi>Priest Curate</hi> ſhould have one of quantity appointed him, which then was called <hi>Manſo.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Manſo.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>At that time</hi> the Cuſtom of giving <hi>Tythes</hi> unto <hi>Pariſh Churches</hi> paſſed over into <hi>Italy,</hi> which long before had been introduced in <hi>France.</hi>

               </note> Therefore <hi>Charles</hi> added anew, that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> as Superintendant, and Paſtor-general, might give that order upon the Diſtribution of Tithes, as he thought fit; wherefore the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> where the Tithes were many and fat ones, diſpoſed of them different wayes, part they attributed to

            <p>True it is, that <hi>Charles</hi> being dead, when the Emperours of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity were weak in Power or in the Brains, the <hi>Popes elected by the People</hi> cauſed themſelves to be <hi>Conſecrated</hi> without expecting a <hi>Decree</hi> from the Emperour.

            </p>
            <p>Much leſs did he hold the chief place, but the <hi>Arch-Priest</hi> held it, who gave himſelf this Title alſo; <hi>Servans Locum ſancti ſedi Apostolicae:</hi> But after the Princes were excluded, as ſhall be ſpoken of in its place, the time was never long between the Election and the Conſecration; and it was not ſaid that the <hi>Election alone</hi> gave the <hi>Popedom,</hi> but the <hi>Conſecration;</hi> wherefore if any one elected, died before he was conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, he was not put into the Catalogue or number of the Popes, as happened to one <hi>Stephen,</hi>

            <p>The Affairs eſtabliſhed by <hi>Charlemain</hi> had no long duration,<note place="margin">N. 68.</note> through the little worth of the Princes of his Poſterity who held the Empire; whereupon beyond the <hi>Alps</hi> things eaſily returned to their firſt Abuſes; the <hi>People</hi> in few places, and very ſeldom had <hi>any ſhare</hi> in the chooſing of the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and not much in the choice of the other Eccleſiaſtical Miniſters; but the <hi>Biſhops ordained</hi> and gave Benefices to whom they pleaſed, except when ſome man was propoſed by the <hi>Prince,</hi> in which caſe they failed not to obey. <hi>The Pope of Rome was always elected by the People,</hi> and confirmed by the Emperour afore he was conſecrated, and the other <hi>Italian Biſhops</hi> were not conſecrated unleſs the Emperour had firſt approved of them.

               <note place="margin">N. 71.</note> In <hi>France</hi> was a Faſhion invented, which though it appeared in favour of Secular men, the Churches thereby encreaſed unto immenſe Riches, and this was a <hi>Contract</hi> called <hi>Precarius,</hi>

            <p>Great Confuſions in <hi>Italy</hi> followed upon theſe times, as well in the Civil Government, as in the Eccleſiaſtical, and ſpecially in the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, unto the year 963, wherein for 80 years,<note place="margin">N. 72.</note> none ſought after a true Form and Face of the Churches Condition, but only for a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Preparative for a change, and a Chaos of Impiety. <hi>Popes</hi> were Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated by their Succeſſors, and the Acts made by them were An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled, and cut in pieces, and the Sacraments Adminiſtred; Six <hi>Popes</hi> were driven out by them who would put themſelves in their <hi>Room,</hi> and <hi>two alſo kill'd,</hi> and <hi>Pope Stephen</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> was ſo ill favouredly deformed in his Face, that he never ſhew'd himſelf in Publick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John the 10th,</hi> was made <hi>Pope</hi> by <hi>Theodora</hi> a notable <hi>Roman Harlot,</hi> through the Faction which her Publick Lover had in <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>John the 11th,</hi> who was a <hi>Bastard</hi>-Son of another <hi>Pope</hi> dead 18 years before, was made <hi>Pope</hi> at the Age of twenty, and ſo many inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies did ariſe in thoſe years, that the Writers ſay that thoſe times af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded <hi>no Popes, but Monsters.</hi>

               <hi>Cardinal Baronius</hi> not knowing how to excuſe any of theſe Diſorders, ſaid that the Church then was for the moſt part without a <hi>Pope,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 73.</note> but not without a <hi>Head,</hi> its <hi>Spiritual Head Chriſt</hi> being in Heaven, and forſakes it not; and it is very certain that Chriſt hath not left, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will leave his Church, neither can his Divine Promiſe fail, that he would be with it unto the end of the World, and in this every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ought to feel and to Believe what <hi>Baronius</hi> ſaith, thinking alſo that what then happened, came to paſs formerly, and as in thoſe times the ſole Aſſiſtance of Chriſt preſerved his Church, ſo it will preſerve it in all ſuch like Accidents, in the like manner, although there were no <hi>Papal Miniſtery.</hi> Each one of himſelf may judge how the other Churches of <hi>Italy</hi> were uſed, conſidering what is the Condition of all the Members, when the Head is grievouſly indiſpoſed.<note place="margin">Biſhopricks given to Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Boyes.

               <note place="margin">N. 74.</note> and even <hi>unto Boyes in their Childhood. Earl Herbert,</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> made his Son of <hi>five years old Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Reims,</hi> and <hi>Pope John</hi> the <hi>10th,</hi> Confirmed that Election.

            <p>
               <hi>The People</hi> partly through their ſimplicity, and partly through Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of Potent men, approved of that which they could not hinder; whereupon an Opinion was grounded, that what thing ſoever if it had its Confirmation from <hi>Rome,</hi> every paſt error was covered.</p>
            <p>Some might believe,<note place="margin">N. 75.</note> that the little care which the Eccleſiaſtical Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der had of Spiritual things, would have cooled the Fervency of Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men, in giving to the Churches, and that the new Purchaſes or Acquiſitions of the Clergy men would have been at an end; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs it was not ſo. For by how much the Spiritual Cure was dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in the Prelates, by ſo much they were intent in the preſerving of their Temporal Goods, and they had Converted the Spiritual Arms of Excommunicating,<note place="margin">Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</note> 
               <hi>which was uſed only for the</hi> Correction of Sinners, into the <hi>Defence of their Temporal Poſſeſſions,</hi> and for the Recovery of them alſo, if by chance the little Care of the Predeceſſor had let any thing be loſt, and the <hi>Terror of the Cenſure</hi> was ſo great amongſt the People, that nothing put them into a greater Fright, and 'twas a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful thing that Captains and Souldiers, moſt wicked in other things and without any fear of God, uſurping their Neighbours Right with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard of offending his Divine Majeſty, preſerved with great Reſpect the things of the Church for fear of the Cenſures.</p>
            <p>From hence,<note place="margin">N. 76.</note> many of ſlender Power, being moved with deſire of ſecuring their own from Violences, made Donation thereof to the Church,<note place="margin">Bequeſts on condition.</note> 
               <hi>upon condition</hi> that it ſhould give it in Fee, with a ſlight ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment. This ſecured the Eſtates which belonged not to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent men, as thoſe whoſe Dominion belonged directly to the Church, afterwards the Heirs male of the Feoditaries Failing, which often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by frequent wars and Popular Seditions, that the Eſtates fell to the Church.</p>
            <p>Seeing that hitherto we have declared in what manner Eccleſiaſtical Eſtates have been acquired, and the <hi>Reaſon of Tything</hi> thoſe of the Laity, this place perſwades that the queſtion debated in our times ſhould be treated and reſolved before we paſs any further; that is to ſay, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eccleſiastical Estates</hi> be Poſſeſſed by Divine or Humane Right,<note place="margin">Queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiaſtical E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.</note> and who ſhould have the Dominion of them?</p>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60809:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>and afterwards by grant from the Emperors, had the Power of Purchaſing, and there is the Canon annexed: <hi>Quo Jure d.</hi> 8. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is affirmed that by the only Fundamental of humane Laws, it is ſaid this Poſſeſſion is mine, this Servant is mine, and that taking away the Laws of the Prince, neither Church, nor any one elſe can ſay, that any thing is their own. And no man can doubt, but that the diviſion of Poſſeſſions was by the <hi>Civil Law,</hi> and likewiſe the manner of <hi>Transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Dominions</hi> from one to another, as the giving, the bequeathing by Will, and all Contractings and Diſpoſings are <hi>humane Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Commonwealths and Kingdoms have been where the Teſtament hath been unknown, <hi>Jure Romano,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 78.</note> 'tis granted to the <hi>Citizens</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make a Will; It is not poſſible, that the manner of <hi>Purchaſing</hi> ſhould be by <hi>humane Right,</hi> and the Continuation of Purchaſing ſhould be <hi>by Divine:</hi> When any thing is given or bequeathed to the Church, there being a difficulty in it, whether the Title be valid or no, it is judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by humane Laws, and holding the Lawful Right, Poſſeſſion is given according to them; Therefore ſtill in Virtue of them, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, one is continued in the Dominion and in the Poſſeſſion: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every one agrees in this, i'le go no further, only I ſhall add as for a Corrollary, which is clearly reſolved from hence and without Difficulty, whether the Exemptions which Eccleſiaſtical Poſſeſſions have,<note place="margin">Exemptions.</note> are by <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> or <hi>humano;</hi> Seeing that Poſſeſſing and the manner of Poſſeſſing proceed alwayes from the ſame Law; and the Juriſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults ſay, that from thence proceeds the <hi>Bondage,</hi> or the <hi>Freedom</hi> of <hi>Eſtates</hi> in Land, from whence alſo Dominion is derived.<note place="margin">N. 79.</note> It would be a great Contradiction to ſay, that the Church ſhould have a Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>(Jure Vaneto)</hi> by the Right or Law of <hi>Venice,</hi> which ſhould have a Liberty <hi>(alio Jure)</hi> by another Law.</p>
            <p>But as touching <hi>Tythes,</hi> there are two opinions, one of the <hi>Canoniſts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tythes.</note> the other of the <hi>Divines,</hi> and of the <hi>Canonists</hi> who together ſtudy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Scripture.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Canonists</hi> ſay that <hi>Tythes are Jure Divino,</hi> becauſe in the old Teſtament God gave <hi>Tythe</hi> unto the <hi>Levites,</hi> as the Holy Scripture Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and 'tis no wonder that they ſay ſo, becauſe they are not verſed in the Readings of the Sacred Books, their Profeſſion not being to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Myſteries of Chriſtian Religion, which is that God gave by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> People <hi>the Law, which as to Ceremonial and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial things,</hi> was proper to that Nation until the <hi>coming of Chriſt,</hi> who was to take away the obligatory Power of it, ſo that the Law of <hi>Tythes is indeed Moſaically Divine,</hi> but <hi>not a Law Naturally Divine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 80.</note> 
               <hi>nor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> and it obliged only that People at that time, now it obligeth none. He that Governs a Common Wealth, may make Laws like unto thoſe, but they ſhall not oblige <hi>as Divine,</hi> neither ought they to be called ſuch, but Civil Laws of the Prince who Conſtitutes them; there was a <hi>Moſaical Divine Law,</hi> that a <hi>Blaſphemer</hi> ſhould be <hi>put to Death,</hi> this obligeth us not now, neither doth he ſin who kills him not, and the Prince may impoſe a Capital puniſhment for Blaſphemy, and it would be juſt, and ought to be obſerved, but it ſhould not therefore be called a Divine Law, although God gave it formerly to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> People, but a Politick Law of the Prince. In theſe and in many other occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences where theſe men alledge the old Scripture for their Intereſt, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning thereunto that it is <hi>de Jure Divino,</hi> it behooveth to diſtinguiſh their Equivocation, that <hi>That which is de Jure Divino Natural or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60809:17"/>obligeth us,</hi> but that which is <hi>de Jure Divino Moſaical</hi> obligeth us not, and he that hath a Government making a Statute like unto that, it is <hi>de Jure Humano.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot forbear ſaying,<note place="margin">N. 81.</note> that they deal not in this manner out of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,<note place="margin">Jus Divinum.</note> but to deceive the incautelous, and to ſtrengthen their own Affairs, by and with the Name of <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> and to give it Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but they may be convinced here, and have their mouths ſtopt. In this ſame Conteſt of the Scripture where God commands <hi>Tythe</hi> ſhould be given to the <hi>Levites,</hi>

            <p>But beſides; God Commanded the <hi>Tythes</hi> only <hi>of the Fruits of the Earth,</hi> and the <hi>Canon Laws</hi> ſay, they muſt be paid alſo out of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, out of the Militia, out of Hunting, and out of whatſoever Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-work whereby gain is made.

               <note place="margin">N. 82.</note> The Divines (for I name never a one in Particular, becauſe none is excluded) and many Canoniſts with them ſay unanimouſly, it is a <hi>Precept of Divine natural Law,</hi> that the Miniſter of Religion ſhould live by his Office, which he affords by ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the People in Divine things, and that it is a ſpecial Precept of Chriſt our Lord in the Goſpel, that the Miniſter who ſerves the People in Preaching the Word of God, and in Eccleſiaſtical Miniſtry, ſhould be furniſhed with a Livelyhood, in what quantity is not determined, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that according to the number of Perſons, and according to the Condition of Places and of Times, abounding at one time, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at another, ſo that <hi>allowing a ſhare to the Miniſter of Christ, is de Jure Divino.</hi> But that this ſhare ſhould be a Tenth, or a Twentyeth, or a greater or a leſſer Proportion, this is eſtabliſhed by humane Law or by Cuſtom, which are of equal value.

            <p>By this Reſolution it remains alſo eaſily decided, whether Benefices or Livings are <hi>de Jure Divino,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 84.</note> or <hi>de Jure Poſitivo?</hi> becauſe Eſtates in Land and Tythes being Poſſeſſed <hi>de Jure Humano,</hi> the Benefices alſo being grounded upon them, will have the Power of the ſame Law, beſides one may certifie ones ſelf hereof more eaſily from the things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſaid: For if the Church hath been ſo many years with Eſtates en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60809:17"/>in Common, and not divided into Benefices as is above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is an <hi>evident thing that Benefices</hi> have been Created by men <hi>in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of time,</hi> and in this all agree. I will not enlarge my ſelf further, only ſhall ſay, that if theſe Conſiderations ſeem ſomewhat ſubtil, yet they are neceſſary, as the following matters ſhall declare.</p>
            <p>From the Reſolution of the firſt Queſtion, it would be clear what to Anſwer unto the ſecond, by him that hath the Dominion of Church Goods (I mean of Eſtates in Land, becauſe of Fruits ſhall be ſpoken of in its place, which is the fourth Queſtion) for if they be Poſſeſſed by Humane Laws,<note place="margin">N. 85.</note> there remains but to ſee unto whom theſe Laws hath granted them. Some ſay, that theſe Goods are from God, and without doubt they ſay true, becauſe Divine Scripture ſayes plainly, all the Earth is the Lords and the fulneſs thereof. But in this manner all things are from God, and no more theſe Goods, than any others; the Divine is a kind of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Dominion,</hi> another Dominion hath eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prince who is Supream in his State, which according to <hi>Seneca</hi> may be called, <hi>Dominion of Empire,</hi> or elſe according to the Doctrine of the Juriſconſults <hi>Dominion of Protection, and of Juriſdiction:</hi> Another, each private man hath, which is the <hi>Dominion of Propriety,</hi> whereof we ſpeak, and wherein we now make enquiry; one cannot ſay that God hath the univerſal Dominion of all things, but that he hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Propriety of thoſe Goods, as the King hath the univerſal in all the Kingdom, and nevertheleſs he poſſeſſeth in Private, and hath the Propriety of that Portion which belongs to his own Houſe.<note place="margin">N. 86.</note> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one may make an Addition to the univerſal Dominion of the Prince, with the Particular of Propriety, whereby it encreaſeth, and is Augmented; but Gods Dominion hath an univerſality ſo excellent and ſo infinite, that it can receive no Addition, and repugneth to be particularized, as it alſo repugneth to be Communicated to any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whatſoever, therefore no man can ſay, God being Maſter of theſe Goods, I who have the ſame Tribunal, the ſame Conſiſtory, and the ſame Court as he, I am Maſter alſo, but rather he is no leſs a Servant of whomſoever is leaſt.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding others vending or uttering freely without fear, ſay,<note place="margin">Pope Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſator not Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus.</note> that the Pope is Maſter and hath the Dominion, and this they prove by the Decretal of <hi>Clement the 4th,</hi> that the Plenary Diſpoſition of all Benefices belongs to them.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Thomas</hi> oppoſeth himſelf to this opinion, in ſaying, that the Pope indeed may call himſelf chief Diſpenſator, but in no wiſe may he be called, either Maſter, or Poſſeſſor,<note place="margin">N. 87.</note> which Doctrine <hi>Cardinal Gaeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> explaineth, adding that the Pope cannot give, nor in any wiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Eccleſiaſtical Goods, but only do with them as much as may be done, being upon the Term of Diſpenſator.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Gaetanus</hi>'s Reaſon is very clear and Efficacious, theſe Goods were at firſt belonging to a Maſter, who hath transferred his Dominion by Donation or by Teſtament, but none of theſe had ever Intention to give or leave to the Pope; therefore the Dominion hath not paſſed unto him; wherefore the ſame <hi>Gaetanus</hi> and <hi>Adrian 6th Pope ſay,</hi> that the Dominion of Eſtates is in the Church, <hi>that is in Generality or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality of the Faithful</hi> of the place, to which the Goods or Eſtates is left, ſo that the Dominion of the Goods of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> is in the Univerſality of the <hi>Romans.</hi> 'Tis known by all, that Univerſality in Right is like a Perſon capable of Poſſeſſing, in which manner it is
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60809:18"/>ſaid, ſuch a thing is common to the City, that is, no mans in particular but all mens together.</p>
            <p>They leave many Wills after this manner,<note place="margin">N. 88.</note> as I leave to the School of St. <hi>Rocco,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rocco.</note> to the Monaſtery of the Fryers, &amp;c. This Doctrine is very well Confirmed by the Antient Cuſtom of the Church, and by the manner of ſpeaking of the Canons: There is no doubt, that if they were to denominate Eſtates in Land by the name of a Perſon, they would denominate it from him who hath the Dominion; but all the Canons and the Antient Cuſtom calls them <hi>Church Lands or Goods,</hi> therefore ſhe hath the Dominion of them, neither have thoſe any other opinion who ſay theſe Goods are Chriſts, becauſe all the Chriſtian Churches from moſt Antient times have been denominated, not only from the name of the City, but alſo from the name of him who hath been the firſt and the moſt famous Biſhop therein, as the <hi>Roman</hi> is called St. <hi>Peters,</hi> that of <hi>Alexandria</hi> St. <hi>Marks,</hi> that of <hi>Ravenna</hi> St. <hi>Apolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare</hi>'s; whereupon the Lands of thoſe Churches took the name of the ſame Saints, and the Lands of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church are called St. <hi>Peters;</hi> wherefore theſe kind of Phraſes are Read amongſt all the Antient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,<note place="margin">N. 89.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Peters Patrimony,</hi> St. <hi>Peters Lands,</hi> the Poſſeſſions of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> the Patrimony of St. <hi>Apollinare,</hi> the Revenue of St. <hi>Apollinare,</hi> &amp;c. And becauſe Chriſt is univerſal Head and Protector of all Churches, that which belongs to the univerſal Church, and to any particular Church, is called <hi>Christs Patrimony,</hi> Chriſts Goods or Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ſignifies ſo much as belonging to the <hi>Church,</hi> whoſe Head Chriſt is: Not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that the Lands of the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> are called St. <hi>Marks,</hi> that is, belonging to that Republick which bears St <hi>Marks</hi> name. And truly that univerſality of the Church, was Miſtreſs of all that was gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when the Clergy-men in each Dioceſs were in Common, becauſe all Donations, and all Teſtaments were made thereunto. Certain it is, that theſe Eſtates were not, neither could they be Purchaſed, but by him to whom the Law granted the Power of Purchaſing, but the Laws of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> granted that Donations might be made to the Chriſtian Colledges,<note place="margin">N. 90.</note> 
               <hi>that is,</hi> to the <hi>univerſality</hi> of the Chriſtians which were in Cities, then the Dominion belonged to thoſe Colledges; but after the diviſions were made, and the Benefices Inſtituted, Legacies or Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were made unto particular Churches, or rather for the moſt part, for ſome particular Pious work in thoſe Churches, wherefore it cannot be ſaid, who is the Maſter of any thing whatſoever, without ſeeing the Bequeathing of the Wills and of the Donors, whereto we being to ſpeak fundamentally, we can ſay no more, but that <hi>Prelates, and other Clergy-men,</hi> are the <hi>Governors, Adminiſtrators,</hi> and Diſpenſators of the <hi>Church Goods, to do therewith</hi> according to the Bequeſt of the Donor or the Leaver, and not otherwiſe, and that Perſon is Maſter either Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular or General in favour of whom the Donation or the Legacy was made. Wherefore alſo every Rector of a Church ought to ſee dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently after the obligations left him to perform, and if it be done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it muſt be imputed to humane Imperfection, no man can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that through length of time,<note place="margin">N. 91.</note> he may have a Preſcription, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Preſuppoſeth a good Faith which never was in any man, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one knowing in his Conſcience, that thoſe goods were not left to be done with, as they do.</p>
            <p>But in whoſe Dominion ſhall thoſe Church-Lands be, whoſe Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not known? The Natural and the Civil Law is, that in thoſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60809:18"/>whoſe private Patron or Maſter hath totally failed, the <hi>Community ſhall Succeed,</hi> therefore the Church muſt remain Miſtreſs thereof. So that in few words men who are beneficed, are <hi>Diſpenſators</hi> of the Goods of the Benefices, but <hi>Master</hi> he is not in favour of him who made the Donation or the Will, and if it be not known, the <hi>Church</hi> remains <hi>Mistreſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis no obſtacle hereunto, that there be Princes Laws and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical, which forbid Alienation, for the Pupill is true Maſter of his own, and yet he cannot Alienate;<note place="margin">N. 92.</note> 
               <hi>Dominion</hi> is a Right of doing what one will with a thing, when the Law permits, which binds ſome ſort of Perſons with Conditions, who have need of the Government of others, ſuch is <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> or <hi>Community.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No man ought to wonder, if ſo many modern Writers in ſuch like Queſtions as in this, which makes the <hi>Pope abſolute Maſter</hi> of all the Benefices, and of all Eccleſiaſtical Eſtates, do defend Opinions contrary to Antiquity, and contrary to thoſe Inſtitutions which had their Riſe from the <hi>Apostles themſelves,</hi> and from <hi>Apoſtolical men,</hi> becauſe that as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> very ſenſibly Complained, that it is one of the Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of man, that whereas Cuſtoms ſhould be Conformable to good Doctrine and to Laws, on the contrary, the Doctrine of Intereſſed men accommodates it ſelf to the Cuſtomes, and it is obſervable, that in all the courſe of ſo many Ages, there hath been no <hi>Novelty</hi> introduced, even concerning <hi>Religion,</hi> but immediately it hath met with <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a wonder will it be,<note place="margin">N. 93.</note> that this ſhould happen in thoſe Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Introductions, which ſerve for Wealth, Eaſe, and humane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns whereunto many may aſpire?</p>
            <p>The Confuſion which was in <hi>Italy</hi> in Politick Affairs, by reaſon of ſo many Kings and Emperors which were made in thoſe times, cauſed alſo an extream diſorder in other Cities about Eccleſiaſtical Affairs; Biſhops and Abbots being ſometimes <hi>made by Princes,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>intruded by</hi> their own Power, and other Eccleſiaſtical Miniſters likewiſe were <hi>ſometimes made,</hi> by thoſe who bore ſway in the Cities, and <hi>ſometimes by the</hi> Biſhops; and now and then <hi>Benefices</hi> were Poſſeſſed by him who had Power or <hi>popular Favour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 963, <hi>Otho a Saxon</hi> brought his Arms into <hi>Italy,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Maſter of it, and to give Form unto the Government, he Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a little Council of Biſhops, <hi>deprived Pope John 12th,</hi> who being made Pope in his Minority under the Age of 18, by the chief of the <hi>Roman</hi> Nobility, and by a great Concourſe in that City,<note place="margin">N. 94.</note> and lived in the Popedome, Committing <hi>Adulteries, Perjuries,</hi> and other irreligious Cuſtomes, <hi>Otho</hi> made him to be renounced by the People, and by Pope <hi>Leo the 8th,</hi> Created by him inſtead of <hi>John:</hi> The Authority of creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pope, and the other Biſhops in <hi>Italy,</hi> he retained, and his Son and his Nephew of the ſame name, unto the year 1001, for the ſpace of 36 years, and during the number of <hi>twelve Popes</hi> which were in that time. Two of them were Created quietly by the Prince, the others in Seditions, for which cauſe the firſt <hi>Otho</hi> carryed one Priſoner into <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Otho the third</hi> carryed another; one was ſtrangled by him, who had a mind to be made in his Room; one run away having Robb'd the Treaſury of the Church Ornaments, and another withdrew himſelf into a voluntary Exile, ſo that in theſe years we <hi>meet with</hi> Popes, yet as <hi>Baronius</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Scontriame.</note> they are in the Catalogue only to fill up
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60809:19"/>the Number, for as to the Reſt, the Church <hi>had no other head but Christ.</hi> The other Biſhops and the Abbots were Created by the Emperors with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Contradiction,<note place="margin">N. 95.</note> and the manner was that when <hi>a Biſhop dyed, his Croſier-Staff</hi> and his <hi>Ring</hi> were <hi>carryed to the Emperor,</hi> who having determined on whom to beſtow the Benefice, he inveſted him by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him the <hi>Ring</hi> and the <hi>Staff,</hi> upon Receiving of which Tokens he went into Poſſeſſion, and got himſelf <hi>Conſecrated</hi> by his <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> or by the Neighbouring Biſhops, which Cuſtom was obſerved alſo in <hi>France</hi> and in <hi>Germany:</hi> Other ſmaller Benefices were Conferr'd by the <hi>Biſhops</hi> or by the <hi>Abbots</hi> under whom they were, unleſs the Prince No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated any one to a Vacant <hi>Benefice:</hi> For to ſuch a one it was given without any Reply, or if he were Recommended by the Prince to have a Benefice when it ſhould be Vacant, who by reaſon of that Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion granted by the Prince, came to be provided by the Biſhop with the firſt Vacancy: Thus did the <hi>Otho</hi>'s Govern without Contradiction from the Popes, although the ſecond of them dwelt a very long time in <hi>Rome,</hi> where he dyed alſo, and was buryed.</p>
            <p>After the Death of the <hi>Othos,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 96.</note> there was preſerved among the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Emperors, the ſame Power of Beſtowing of Biſhopricks and Abbeys, and alſo of Nominating unto inferior Benefices, or elſe of <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Expectancies</hi> of Benefices which were to become Vacant.

In <hi>France</hi> the Decree was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by the King, but he continued according to Cuſtom, and alſo the Emperor <hi>Henry 2d</hi> the Son oppoſed it, who in the year 1110 came Armed into <hi>Italy,</hi> for the Crown of the Empire, to which the Pope having oppoſed himſelf by Controverſies depending between them, they agreed that <hi>Henry</hi> ſhould go to <hi>Rome</hi> for the Crown,<note place="margin">N. 104.</note> put the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie of Inveſtitures to ſilence, neither party being to ſpeak of them. <hi>Henry</hi> went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where <hi>Pope Paſchal</hi> appearing to him to be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior in ſtrength, not remaining firm in the Conditions, he would have him to <hi>renounce</hi> the <hi>Inveſtitures,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> confiding in his bold Forces, propoſed on the contrary, that the Pope ſhould revoke the Decrees, ſaying, he would not be inferior to <hi>Charlemain, Ludovicus Pius,</hi> and other <hi>Emperors</hi> who had given the Inveſtitures Peaceably and quietly; whereupon the Contentions encreaſing, the <hi>Emperor</hi> took the <hi>Pope Priſoner,</hi> and the moſt part of the Cardinals, carrying them from the City; an Accommodation was treated on, and finally the Pope agreed to Crown him, and to let him have the Conferring of Benefices, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Excommunicating him for it, and he Swore to the obſervation of the Agreement, and the Maſs being Celebrated, <hi>the Pope divided the Wafer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 105.</note> and with one half he Communicated himſelf, and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror with the other half, making Curſed and dreadful Imprecations, for which of them ſhould be a Violater of the Agreement.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> gone back to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſaid he would obſerve the Agreement, but yet his <hi>Legates</hi> Excommunicated the Emperor and he two years after in 1112.

Theſe three <hi>Popes</hi> did not only make uſe of Excommunicating, but alſo ſtirr'd up many Seditions againſt the Emperor. The chief of one was <hi>Lotharius</hi> a <hi>Saxon,</hi> who took up Arms, and had many Victories; finally in the year 1122. <hi>Henry</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving himſelf in ſo many difficulties, renounced the Inveſtiture,<note place="margin">N. 106.</note> and a Tumult was appeaſed which had laſted 56 years, under <hi>Six Popes,</hi> by Excommunicating an infinite number of Perſons, both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, who adhered to the Emperor, and by the Death of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs Perſons on both ſides, in <hi>threeſcore Battels</hi> fought by <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> and in <hi>eighteen</hi> fought by <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Son; tantae Molis erat,</hi> to lay the Foundations of that Building, which we have ſeen brought up to the Top of the Battlements, whereof we are to ſpeak.</p>
            <p>In the Occurrence aboveſaid happened between <hi>Paſcal,</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> the Judgment of the World was various, ſome ſaying, that the Aſſent yielded unto by the Pope was <hi>Null,</hi> as done out of fear, finding himſelf and ſo many Cardinals in the Emperors hand, and therefore with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>Paſcal</hi> oppoſed him, and ceaſed from obſerving it: But on the other ſide, it was ſaid, that if the <hi>Popes</hi> Aſſent were invalid for being extorted with Fear,<note place="margin">N. 107.</note> no leſs ought to be held for invalid the Aſſent yielded to by the Emperor, for Fear of ſo many Excommunications and Anathema's, of ſo many Rebellions and Machinations; for which cauſe he is ſubject to reſtore that which is done for Fear of Impriſonment and not that which is done for Fear of Anathema's, and for Fear of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his Dominions and People in Confuſion, and in Civil Wars. Some men in Counſel in the preſence of <hi>Paſcal,</hi> made uſe of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma; if the <hi>Decree,</hi> and the <hi>Bull</hi> of his, by which he granted Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiture unto the Emperor were Lawful, they ought to be obſerved, if they were unjuſt, and as ſome ſay Heretical, then was the <hi>Pope</hi> Author alſo Heretical, and unjuſt: 'Tis true indeed, that a thing juſt and due although done out of Fear, is valid, and that no man whatſoever is blameleſs, if for any kind of Fear he acteth contrary to the Law of God.</p>
            <p>The Contention of the Popes with the Emperors, about this matter of giving Inveſtiture of Biſhopricks and Abbeys, ſtopt not only in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> Kingdoms of the Emperor, but in the ſame times alſo in <hi>France,</hi> ſome of the Biſhops ſtirr'd up by Example, and through Intereſt,<note place="margin">N. 108.</note> oppoſed the King for the ſame cauſe; but becauſe all were not agreed to make a League with the <hi>Pope</hi> againſt the <hi>King,</hi> the King for the moſt part overcame him, and the Popes were content to gain that by little and little, which was Impoſſible for them to do all at once together.</p>
            <p>In <hi>England</hi> the King having alwayes conferr'd Biſhopricks, and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys, in the year 1102, <hi>Anſelm Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> refuſed to Conſecrate the Biſhops provided by the King, he adhering to the Decrees made by the Popes, and the Contention laſted many years, the King maintaining his Authority, and the Arch-Biſhop by the help of the <hi>Pope</hi> defending his Oppoſition; the King believed himſelf able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the <hi>Pope</hi> to that which he reputed Juſt, therefore he ſent an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, who received ſuch rough Anſwers and Threatnings from the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60809:21"/>
               <hi>Pope,</hi> that to take off his Edge, the Ambaſſador thought fit to tell him, the <hi>King</hi> would not loſe his Authority, although he were to loſe his Kingdom, to which the Pope replyed with no leſs boldneſs that he would not permit it, although he were to loſe his Head.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> remained Conſtant,<note place="margin">N. 109.</note> and it behooved <hi>Anſelm</hi> to depart the Kingdom, incapable of returning, without Conſenting to the King's Will. But the <hi>King</hi> dying without Heirs-Male, and ſome Civil Wars happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 'twas eaſie for the Clergy-men to prevail, and to introduce That into <hi>England,</hi> which had been introduced in the Empire, where after the Ceſſion of <hi>Henry,</hi> of which hath been ſpoken, the <hi>Pope</hi> obtained his intent; true it is, that in the year 1132, <hi>Lotharius the Saxon</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of <hi>Henry the 5th Emperor,</hi> being ſought to by <hi>Innocent</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> engaged in a Schiſm, that he would acknowledge him for <hi>Pope,</hi> and not his Adverſary; refuſed to do it, unleſs the Inveſtitures Renounced by <hi>Henry</hi> were reſtored to him; and perhaps the <hi>Pope</hi> would have grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, but <hi>St. Bernard</hi> very intimate with <hi>Lotharius</hi> perſwaded him to deſiſt, propoſing to his Conſideration, that he having made War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Henry</hi> his Predeceſſor and Lord, upon <hi>Pope Paſchals</hi> Inſtance for that cauſe,<note place="margin">N. 110.</note> afterwards to be willing to make himſelf a Defender of <hi>Henry's</hi> Pretention, was to declare himſelf a Rebel, and that he had made War againſt his Lord, while he was defending a juſt Cauſe.</p>
            <p>That which uſually happens after great Victories, namely when all the Forces of the Enemy are not Extinct, the Fragments or the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the overcome Party, oftentimes ſpring up again with old Pretenſions, which the prudent Vainquiſher temporizeth dexterouſly, rather than oppoſe himſelf openly by renewing a War, ſo it fell out in theſe preſent occaſions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Popes</hi> not being able to have the Victory, of ſuch a great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention ſo entirely, but that in ſome Places, ſome Benefices would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Power of the Laity, and that a Prince ſometimes for ſome Neceſſity of his Government, without Regard to the <hi>Pope,</hi> would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ſome Biſhoprick after the firſt manner; There remained in <hi>France</hi> the <hi>Regalia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 111.</note> which is a Right of the King to Confer all ſingle Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Vacant by the death of the Biſhops, until the Succeſſor be Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; There remained in <hi>Germany</hi> a Right of the Emperors, of giving <hi>only one of the Canon-ſhips</hi> in many Churches, and ſo divers particular Authorities were retained by ſome Princes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Popes</hi> that they might not (by Contending for theſe particular uſes) renew the Contention with hazard of loſing the whole, or elſe by letting them run on, they might do prejudice to the general Cauſe, thought it requiſite to make Proviſion, both by Negotiation and Art. They found a Temperament or Complyance, by cauſing the Canoniſts and other Scribes depending on them, to Write that theſe Princes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd that Authority, through Priviledge granted by the <hi>Pope:</hi> This ſerved the <hi>Popes</hi> for a Reputation, to make appear that Princes had no Right, but by their grace and favour, and aſſured them alſo that they might pretend further, and 'twas eaſily paſſed over by the Princes, to whom it ſeemed, that it was to ſecure them from the Moleſtations which the Popes might give them,<note place="margin">N. 112.</note> and by adding an Eccleſiaſtical Title to their own Poſſeſſion, make it more ſecure. But the Event ſhew'd that to be Poyſon, which was eſteemed Phyſick; For about 1300, <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> exerciſed ſharp Contentions with <hi>Philip the fair</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> that he ſhould yield up the Authority of the Regalia's aboveſaid, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60809:21"/>they proceeded ſo far, that this Kingdom was expoſed to great Danger, by <hi>Excommunications</hi> and <hi>Interdictions,</hi> by depriving the King, and by granting the Kingdom to <hi>Albert</hi> the <hi>Emperor.</hi> At firſt when 'twas aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to, it was not well thought of, to whoſe account it would turn by the Apoſtolical granting to preſerve that which was the Princes Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar; For the <hi>Popes</hi> ſince pretend they can revoke the Priviledges granted by their Predeceſſors, even without a cauſe, though indeed they never want Pretexts to feign a cauſe, and whoſever Poſſeſſeth by a Title of his own, and is content to acknowledge it for another mans Favour, is like him who leaving his own ground, goes to build on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mans.</p>
            <p>But on the other ſide when ſome Prince having broken Patience,<note place="margin">N. 113.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred ſome principal Benefice, which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi> oftentimes did, the <hi>Popes</hi> not to engage in Contentions, ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to the Prince, but not to let themſelves be prejudiced, they wrought by Practiſes through the Monks means, that the Elected ſhould renounce into the Popes hand, promiſing him he ſhould be inveſted by the <hi>Pope,</hi> and ſo ſhould have that quietly, wherewith if he had not been contented, the <hi>Pope</hi> would have oppoſed it, and brought all into difficulty.</p>
            <p>Of theſe Practiſes then uſed frequently by the <hi>Popes, Florentius</hi> of <hi>Wingerin</hi> and <hi>Ivo Carnotenſis,</hi> who were Writers in thoſe times, make a long Relation, as of a thing uſually done in <hi>Germany</hi> and in <hi>France,</hi> with this Form of Words, that <hi>the Popes took with one hand, and gave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with the other.</hi> This agreement was eaſily accepted, as that which freed one from Trouble and Moleſtation, and the ſame King if he came to reflect afterwards,<note place="margin">N. 114.</note> whether he paſt it as a thing which made no Alteration in effect, without conſidering, that it might import for the Future: Which manner they now make uſe of againſt the Catholick <hi>Biſhops</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> who do not obey their Reſervations, as ſhall be ſpoken of in its place.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Spain</hi> the quiet and prudent Diſpoſition of the Nation, together with the good Government of the Kings, were cauſe that in ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal a change they paſſed it quietly; perhaps forwarded hereunto by the Exerciſe the Saracens gave them, which made them think of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining united to their King, and of living in Quietneſs; The Kings never went about ſubjecting the Clergy more than convenient, and they never made a League with Strangers, to exempt themſelves from the Kings more than their due. As ſoon alſo as the Kings perceived, that the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> had by Power, by Terror, or by Practices obtained ſomething in other Kingdoms, they endeavour'd to accommodate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves according to thoſe things,<note place="margin">N. 115.</note> in ſuch a manner as might make the leaſt alteration poſſible in their Government, for as touching the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of times paſt, the Biſhops, and other Eccleſiaſtical Miniſters were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained according to the Antient Cuſtom, the aboveſaid Alteration being made in other Kingdoms and States, they would not lay hold on a Contention with the Popes, but by a prudent Complyance they were contented, that no Biſhop ſhould be Ordained without their Conſent, and <hi>Alphonſo</hi> the <hi>6th,</hi> the better to ſecure himſelf, ſought for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban the ſeconds</hi> Approbation, who granted to the King the <hi>J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S PATRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> of all the Churches in his Kingdom. Thoſe Kings have proceeded quite otherwiſe than the <hi>Germans, French,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh;</hi> They were content to acknowledge for anothers favour that which was
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60809:22"/>their own, ſo that it might ſerve to enjoy it more Peaceably; Theſe have ſtriven that they might not acknowledge their own from another mans, but all with Prudence.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſaw there was a way to loſe all,<note place="margin">N. 116.</note> and to become Subjects, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Popes Demand not the utmoſt ſcope of his Intention, but a Degree of proceeding further; his Subjects conſidered, chiefly the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-men inclinable unto Liberty, not to ſay Licence, and therefore ready to agree with the Stranger, to diminiſh the Authority of their Prince, whereupon they ſaw it neceſſary, that there ſhould be no Door open, by which they might have Recourſe.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being confident of the quietneſs of their Subjects, had no Reaſon to fear, that ſuddenly they would move for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe out of the Kingdom, but conſidering the Anxiety of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in thoſe times, they had good cauſe to fear, leſt thoſe who had been able to make Subjects Rebel againſt Princes ſo much greater than they, ſhould uſe the ſame Arts; and therefore they reſolved moſt Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, to receive ſpeedily that which greater than they were conſtrain'd to tolerate after much Wars.</p>
            <p>Now for a Concluſion,<note place="margin">N. 117.</note> In the time which paſt between 1122, that <hi>Henry</hi> made his Renuntiation, unto 1145, it was eſtabliſhed almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, that the Biſhop being dead, the choice of the Succeſſor ſhould be made by the <hi>Chapter of Canons,</hi> and ſhould be Confirmed by the <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> and if the <hi>Abbot</hi> were dead, the Election ſhould be made by the <hi>Monks,</hi> and Confirmed by the Biſhop, if the Monaſtery were unexempted: If it were exempted, it ſhould be Confirmed by the <hi>Pope:</hi> Other Benefices which were <hi>de J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RE PATRONAT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> were Confer'd by the Biſhop on the Patron's Preſentation: All others were at the free Epiſcopal diſpoſing. The <hi>Popedom</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> remained, for the Prince being Excluded, it ſeemed that it ought to return to the <hi>free Election of the People,</hi> but from the year 1145, <hi>Innocent</hi> the <hi>2d</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Difference with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and being driven from the City by them,<note place="margin">☞</note> he in Counter-change deprived them of the Power of chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Troubles which happened for the cauſes aboveſaid, many Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were in an Uproar by the <hi>Biſhops</hi> Confederate with the Pope, which revolting from the Emperor,<note place="margin">N. 118.</note> and were headed by the Biſhops, whereby they obtained the <hi>Publick Incoms, and the Regal Rights or Duties;</hi> and when the Differences were Compoſed, they had taken ſo firm Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that the Prince was Neceſſitated to grant them in <hi>Feudo</hi> or <hi>Feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> that, which <hi>de Facto</hi> they had uſurped to themſelves, by which they acquired alſo the <hi>Titles of Dukes, Marquiſſes,</hi> and <hi>Earls,</hi> as many of them are in <hi>Germany,</hi> who remain ſtill ſuch, both in Name, and in Fact; but in <hi>Italy,</hi> in <hi>Name only,</hi> which made Clergy-men a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Secular Goods, and the Augmentation was very notable, not only during the Troubles of which we have ſpoken, but alſo in thoſe which followed under the <hi>Swevian Emperors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Monks in this time had intermeddled greatly, in favouring the undertaking of the <hi>Popes</hi> againſt the Princes, for which they loſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what <hi>of their Reputation of Holineſs;</hi> and indeed there was alſo loſt much of the Diſcipline,<note place="margin">N. 119.</note> and Regular obſervance in Monaſteries, becauſe they intermeddled or crept into the <hi>Negotiations of State,</hi> and of War, wherefore their acquiring or purchaſing ceaſed alſo, unleſs in ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Congregations newly inſtituted in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> who intermedled not in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60809:22"/>theſe Commotions, but preſerved their Diſcipline, and therefore the Devotion of the People continuing towards them, they were inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of acquiring New Eſtates, but yet not many, they being but few.</p>
            <p>But another Occaſion happened which cauſed great Acquiſitions in the times whereof hath been ſpoken, which was <hi>the Warfar of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Land,</hi> and the heat of zeal was then ſo earneſt,<note place="margin">The holy War Contributed great Wealth to the <hi>Roman-Church.</hi>
               </note> for going and for contributing to the gaining of it, that men making no account of Goods, of Wives, and of Children, engaged themſelves in this Warfar, and ſelling their own, went beyond Sea; yea the very Women without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Reſpect to their Childbearing, ſold their Goods to contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the War. The <hi>Popes</hi> with their Prieſts, and other Prelates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived under their Protection the Houſes, and the Affairs of the <hi>Cruci-Signati</hi> (ſo were called thoſe who went to the War) and that brought to the Churches ſuch an encreaſe, as is wont to bring the being Tutor,<note place="margin">N. 120.</note> Curate, or a Procurator for Widdows, Orphans, and Perſons under Age; neither could the ſecular Magiſtrate ſo much as think of defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any one, for Terror of the Cenſures which they made uſe of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſparingneſs.</p>
            <p>A great Point was added, which <hi>Eugenius the third</hi> Conſtituted, that for this Pious work, every one might alienate the Fee-Farms he held, which if the Patron could not receive, yet againſt his Will they might be taken by the Churches, which opened a broad way to the purchaſing very largely. It happened alſo that the Popes of <hi>Rome made uſe of the Armes prepared for the holy Land</hi> in ſome Enterpriſe, whereby they augmented the <hi>Temporal Eſtate</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church:</hi> And alſo the Popes Legates, and the Biſhops of the place where the ſaid Arms were met together to unite themſelves for the Voyage, they made uſe of them for divers <hi>Augmentations of the Churches Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There being alſo offered and gathered a great quantity of money,<note place="margin">N. 121.</note> taken from the Faithful, eſpecially from Women and others who were unfit to ſerve in the Wars perſonally, likewiſe to free ones ſelf <hi>from a vow made,</hi> as alſo to obtain <hi>Indulgences</hi> and other <hi>Grants,</hi> all was not ſpent in that War, no doubt but ſome Prince might partake of it, but a notable ſhare remained ſtill in the hands of the <hi>Prelates,</hi> whereby Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Affairs made ſome Augmentation. After this were inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Military Religions of the Templars, Hoſpitallars</hi> &amp;c. for the defence of the <hi>Temple</hi> Built at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for the <hi>Pilgrims</hi> who went thither, and for to fight againſt the <hi>Saracens,</hi> which although it was a new <hi>thing to institute Religions for the ſhedding of blood,</hi> yet it was received with ſo much Fervor, that in a very ſhort time they gained great ſtore of Wealth: All theſe wayes brought great encreaſe of Riches to the Church. There was alſo another way of giving a very notable encreaſe to the Wealth of the Church, or Clergy-men,<note place="margin">N. 122.</note> the <hi>Reviewing well the matter of the Tythes,</hi> and where they were not paid, to proceed with Cenſures that there ſhould or ought be paid not only the <hi>Predials</hi> of the Fruits of the Earth, but <hi>mixt Tythes</hi> alſo, which are the Fruits of Cattel,<note place="margin">Reviewing of Tythes added more Riches.</note> and likewiſe the Tythes of Perſonal Induſtry and humane Labour.</p>

               <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>third</hi> about the year 1170, determined that they ſhould proceed with Excommunications, to cauſe the entire payments for the Tythes of Mills to be made,<note place="margin">N. 123.</note> and of Fiſhing, of Fur, of Wooll, and of Bees, and that the Tythes of every thing ſhould be paid, before the Charges made for the gathering of the Fruits ſhould be deducted; and <hi>Celestin</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> in the year 1195, eſtabliſhed that they ſhould proceed with Excommunications, to cauſe payment to be made of the Tythes not only of the Wine, Corn, Fruits of Trees, of Gardens, of Sheep, of Merchandize, of Souldiers pay, of Hunting, but alſo of Windmills. All theſe things are expreſſed in the <hi>Decretals of the Romiſh Popes;</hi> But the <hi>Canonists</hi> have gone much further, ſaying, that the Poor are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to pay Tythe, for that is given them by Alms in begging at doors, and that the <hi>Harlots</hi> are bound to pay Tythe of their Gain by Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and of ſuch other things which the World could not receive into uſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tythes</hi> were paid unto the Curates, for the ſervice which they afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the People, in Teaching the word of God, in Adminiſtring the Sacraments, and in performing other Eccleſiaſtical Functions; ſo that for theſe Miniſteries nothing was paid;<note place="margin">N. 124.</note> ſome Pious and Rich Perſons gave if they pleaſed, ſomething for the Burying of their dead, or for receiving the Sacraments, and the cuſtom went ſo far, <hi>that Curteſie was turned into a due Debt,</hi> and the quantity how much was to be paid, was alſo brought into a Cuſtom, and came to Controverſies, <hi>Secular men refuſing to pay any thing, for the Administration of the Sacraments, becauſe</hi> they paid <hi>Tythes therefore,</hi> and the Clergy-men denying to perform their Functions, unleſs there were given them that which was Cuſtomary; About the year 1200, <hi>Innocent</hi> the <hi>3d</hi> remedyed this Diſorder, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding the Clergy indeed from Contracting for any thing for their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, and to refuſe it to thoſe who would not pay them, and commanded they ſhould perform the Functions without more ado. But after this was done, by Cenſures the Seculars were forced to obſerve the <hi>Laudable Custom</hi> (as the Pope calls it) in paying that which was uſual, putting a great Difference between forcing before-hand by Contract, and forcing afterwards by Cenſures,<note place="margin">N. 125.</note> approving this as Lawful, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the other as Simoniacal.</p>
            <p>Another Novelty was alſo introduced contrary to the old Canons,<note place="margin">Other wayes of gain.</note> which Contributed much towards their Gain. It <hi>was Prohibited by the Canons, to receive any thing by Donation,</hi> or by Will from ſeveral ſorts of Publick Sinners; as from Sacrilegious Perſons, from him who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in Diſcord with his own Brother, from Harlots and other ſuch Perſons; all theſe Reſpects were quite laid aſide, and all indifferently received, eſpecially the greateſt and moſt <hi>frequent Legacies and Gifts are from Harlots,</hi> and from Perſons who through diſguſt with their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, leave or give to the Church. Thus the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> uſed great diligence to help forward the Purchaſing, as well as to preſerve the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Diſtributing what was Purchaſed, which (as hath been ſaid) was with ſo much Labour and ſo much Blood, ſnatcht or drawn out of the hand of Princes,<note place="margin">N. 126.</note> and reduced to the Clergy. To which all the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical order, for their own Intereſt not only conſented, but help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60809:23"/>it by Preaching, and by Writing, alwayes inculcating that it <hi>was an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation of the People,</hi> and <hi>a Tyranny of Princes to have any ſhare of medling with the Distribution of Benefices,</hi> and chiefly with the <hi>Election of the Pope;</hi> and in our dayes one of the Arguments treated on by <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentus,</hi> throughout all his <hi>Annals,</hi> with all opportunity and importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is this, <hi>that it was with an Impious and a Tyrannical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation of thoſe Princes and People, to intermeddle in the Election of Biſhops, and chiefly of the Pope;</hi> not conſidering that the beſt Popes have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by Princes, and that alwayes when Clergy-men only have made the Election, infinite diſorders have ſprung up: But that which imports more, is, that Popes of a moſt holy Life, and Emperors of perpetual memory, have commended that Practiſe, and judged it neceſſary, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be now blamed, without ſlandering two Dozen of holy Popes, and particularly <hi>St. Gregory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 127.</note> and the Antient Doctrines of the Councils, and of the holy Fathers. If at firſt the Miſtery had been diſcovered, whereto would have tended this taking away the Inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from Princes, the Clergy would not have been perſwaded unto Novelty; but they believed their own Intereſt and liberty were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, wherefore the Practice began of beſtowing Benefices in manner aboveſaid, every one in his Dioceſs, ſome by the Election of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſome by Collation or ſetling of the Biſhop; and likewiſe the Pope beſtowed <hi>thoſe in the Dioceſs</hi> of <hi>Rome, and medled not with giving Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices out of his Dioceſs,</hi> unleſs ſometimes in one caſe only, that is, when any Prelate being gone to <hi>Rome,</hi> either for Devotion or for Buſineſs dyed there, and in his company there hapned to be ſome noted Perſon of the ſame Nation, the Pope immediately Created him in the place of the Deceaſed, and ſent him back, writing to the Dioceſs, or to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, Lamenting the death of the Deceaſed, and conſolating them with the ſubſtitution of the Perſon he had ſent them; This thing was eaſily conſented unto, as well becauſe it hapned but rarely or ſeldom,<note place="margin">N. 128.</note> as becauſe it appeared to be the Popes favour alſo, there being no cauſe of refuſing a Perſon deſerving, and of the ſame Country; but when the news of the death came to the Place, if the Pope had made no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion already in manner aforeſaid, they ſtay'd no longer, but provided of themſelves according to Cuſtom. In <hi>nothing elſe did the Pope med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with Eccleſiastical Cauſes out of the Dioceſs of Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> nevertheleſs was very deſerving from all the Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical order, ſeeing that ſo many <hi>Popes</hi> with ſo much Toyl and Labour, together with ſo much Blood-ſhed had gained them that Power and Dominion over Benefices, and excluded the Princes, who from antient times, and the <hi>People who from the beginning had Poſſeſſion of that Right,</hi> wherefore he was held in great eſteem by the Biſhops, who ſought to gratifie him all the wayes they could; which put the Popes in mind of dealing with the Biſhops after that manner as the Emperors were wont,<note place="margin">N. 129.</note> which was, to recommend one to them to be provided with a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Benefice: At firſt theſe Requeſts ſeemed very ſtrange to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they opening a door by which Strangers or Outlandiſh men got an Inlet to be Beneficyed in their Kingdoms, and yet they were favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly accepted, and anſwered by the Biſhops with gratification, <hi>who only were intent on the Excluding of Princes,</hi> never thought that another by depriving them could aſſume to himſelf the ſettlement of Benefices. But ſhortly after through the Profitableneſs which the Court received from thoſe who made Preſents to obtain the <hi>Popes</hi> favour, and for the <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60809:24"/>of Bulls,</hi> they began to multiply the deſires and the Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Pope</hi> in ſuch a manner, that the Biſhops became deprived of almoſt all Collations: Whereupon they were ſometimes forced to paſs without complying with them; the Popes found a Remedy for this, by adding Commands unto his Requeſts, which were obeyed at firſt,<note place="margin">N. 130.</note> but for being too frequent, it conſtrained the Biſhops to tranſgreſs the Command, and without Reſpect thereunto, or to the Cenſures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Contained, they made Collations in regard to themſelves and to their Churches, and it behoov'd the Pope afterwards to be content for a thing done, and to pardon them, ſeeing there was no other Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
            <p>The courſe whereby Benefices were obtained in <hi>Rome,</hi> would have been eaſily ſtopt, but there was a Remedy invented for it at Court, for beſides the deſires and commands, they added an Executor, who if the Biſhop would not confer the Benefice, he was to confer it, and to puniſh the Biſhop beſides for Diſobedience. However they uſed that Method but ſparingly, and when the Biſhop had been ſtubborn. But at laſt for a quicker diſpatch they came to yield to Prayers, to the Mandate, and to Execution altogether. Wherefore the Churches and the Biſhops felt themſelves much aggrieved,<note place="margin">N. 131.</note> and the Princes and the Nations complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not only for being deprived of their Faculties, but alſo becauſe by that means, the Benefices which by a moſt antient cuſtom were beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Natives, fell all unto ſtrangers, who were at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereupon oftentimes thoſe were made Biſhops and Curates, who underſtood not the Peoples Language, which they were not apt to learn by reaſon of the great Difference, as many <hi>Italians</hi> who were Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in <hi>England,</hi> and the diſorder grew ſo great that he (chiefly the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate) who underſtood not the Language of the People, was forbidden by the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> from having any Benefice, reſerving to himſelf the <hi>Power of Diſpenſing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Power of Diſpenſing.</note> which did not remove the diſorder, but only encreaſed the Charges of the Solliciters or Entreaters, and the Profits of the Court, they not ſticking to give the Reverſions unto ſtrangers, granting them afterwards a <hi>Brief of Diſpenſation.</hi> But although ſuch ample Authority which the <hi>Court of Rome</hi> had aſſumed to it ſelf, was diſpleaſing to men of good zeal, yet it was moſt grateful to a great number of Clergy-men and other Perſons deſirous of Benefices,<note place="margin">N. 132.</note> who were ſubject to Canonical Impediments, which rendred them uncapable: This ſort of Perſons no Biſhop durſt to promote, as retaining the due Reverence to the Canons; Nevertheleſs that which no man would do, the <hi>Pope</hi> did eaſily, diſpenſing againſt Canons and Eccleſiaſtical conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, introducing the ſaying; <hi>de Plenitudine Potestatis;</hi> and the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle clauſe, <hi>non obstantibus,</hi> (a thing unknown and not heard of in ſo many Ages) which is now put into every <hi>Beneficial Bull,</hi> yea the <hi>Popes</hi> themſelves in the diſtribution of the Benefices of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> in good time or times of Proſperity, made Profeſſion of being great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er obſervers of the Canons than any other Biſhops; and one of the glories of the holy Popes, as may be ſeen in <hi>St. Leo,</hi> and his Succeſſors was the punctual obſervance of the Canons, firſt by themſelves, then by others; neither ought it to be ſaid, that theſe were of leſs authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,<note place="margin">N. 133.</note> but certain it is they were of greater goodneſs and knowledge, and they durſt not do otherwiſe, than what was permitted unto others, whereas afterwards every thing was done at <hi>Rome,</hi> which others durſt not do elſewhere.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>St. Barnard</hi> who lived in the firſt times of theſe Introductions, which although they had not paſt ſo formerly as happened afterwards, writing to <hi>Eugenius,</hi> the third, rebukes them ſharply, complaining that the City of <hi>Rome</hi> was the place, whereto the Ambitious, the Covetous, the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſts, the Sacrilegious, the Concubine-keepers, and the Inceſtuous had their Recourſe to <hi>obtain Benefices,</hi> for they found none who would receive them in other places, <hi>Rome</hi> being the only place, which made that Legal or Lawful, which every where elſe was reputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Popes</hi> themſelves could not deny, but that the granting of theſe Expectancies or Reverſions were burdenſome to the Churches, yea <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>9th C. Mandatum de reſcrip.</hi> confeſſeth it with open words, wherefore they were reſtrained by inſerting this little Clauſe, <hi>If we have not written for another,</hi> bringing into Cuſtome,<note place="margin">N. 134.</note> that every <hi>Pope</hi> might grant a Reverſion upon any Church, and no more. Beſides they were wont afterwards at their entrance into the Popedom, to revoke all the Reverſions granted by their Predeceſſor, that their own might take place more eaſily, or elſe that thoſe who had obtained them, might be neceſſitated to have new ones at new Charges, for to Confirm them therein; as for <hi>Elective Benefices,</hi> which are <hi>Biſhopricks</hi> and <hi>Abbeys</hi> they gave no Expectancies or Reverſions, there being no Example of it, for they had been beſtowed by the Princes, but the Court invented other Modes or Wayes, whereby they often drew the Collation of them to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſetting forth many Conditions which were neceſſarily to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, before coming to the Elections, and others in the Celebration thereof, and requiring divers qualities in the Perſon of the Elected,<note place="margin">N. 135.</note> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereunto, that if any of theſe were not obſerved, the Electors were for that time deprived of the Power of Chooſing, <hi>which devolved it ſelf to Rome;</hi> Beſides this alſo, and for divers Reſpects of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, or for other Cauſes, there aroſe amongſt them difficulties about the Election, for which cauſe one of the Parties would <hi>Appeal to Rome,</hi> where moſt commonly the wrong was given to both, and the Election made invalid, and the Collation of the Biſhoprick or Abbey for that time was drawn to <hi>Rome.</hi> Alſo when the Court heard of a vacancy of ſome good Biſhoprick or Abbey which had happened, it diſpatched imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately a Letter Preceptory, that there ſhould be no proceeding to the Election without his knowledge, and with an honeſt ſhew or colour of helping or preventing diſorders which might happen, he ſent a Perſon to aſſiſt and preſide in the Election, through whoſe means by divers wayes and managements, the Election was made to fall on him, who was to be the <hi>greatest Benefactor to Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There happening then for the cauſes above written,<note place="margin">N. 136.</note> that few Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Biſhopricks and of Monaſteries were Celebrated, but for ſome of theſe Reſpects were examined at <hi>Rome,</hi> whereupon the Pope me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated or interpoſed himſelf in moſt of the ſubſequent Elections, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering it with the honeſt Title of <hi>Devolution</hi> for the publick ſervice, ſeeing that the uſual Electors wanted of that which was their due, they thought it convenient to put to their hand alſo, either by commanding when it ſeemed to them, that the Electors ſhould not come to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection without their leave, or that they ſhould not chuſe, but by the Counſel of ſome Perſons nominated by them; thus by different wayes they came to aſſume ſome ſhare in the Elections alſo. Theſe methods variouſly uſed according to the Exigency of Accidents, had not the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60809:25"/>
               <hi>Power of a Law,</hi> but of <hi>Customs,</hi> or of <hi>Reaſonableneſs</hi> unto the year 1227, when <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>9th</hi> having conſidered how <hi>Theodoſius</hi> formed the Politick of the Empire, Collected his Reſcriptions or Decretals and thoſe of Preceeding Princes into a Book,<note place="margin">N. 137.</note> which was afterwards called the <hi>Theodoſian Codex:</hi> And <hi>Justinian</hi> having accommodated the Antient Laws, according to the times then being, and reduced the Decrees of his Predeceſſors into a Body, he called them the <hi>Juſtinian Codex.</hi> So the ſame <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>9th,</hi> framed a Politic, having reduced into a Body all the <hi>Reſcriptions</hi> or <hi>Decretals,</hi> together with the Accidents which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, ſerving to the <hi>Roman Greatneſs,</hi> and having extended that to a common uſe, which had been eſtabliſhed for a particular place, and perhaps for that ſpecial caſe only, and having aboliſhed others, called that Book the <hi>Decretal</hi> of <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>9th,</hi> which began to lay the Foundation, and to eſtabliſh the <hi>Roman Monarchy,</hi> chiefly in <hi>Beneficial matters,</hi> in which Book there is much more concerning the Edification of Law-fruits, than concerning the Edification of Souls.</p>
            <p>The old Collectors of Canons, Particularly <hi>Gratian,</hi> made a Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all that he accounted proper to the Papal greatneſs, yet not without Changes,<note place="margin">N. 138.</note> Alterations, and <hi>Falſifications alſo of the Places from whence the Sentences were taken;</hi> and 'twas believed by him he had raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Authority to the greateſt height it could attain unto, and for thoſe times he was not miſtaken; but Affairs being altered, that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilement was not for his purpoſe, but after that which he called <hi>his Decree,</hi> followed this <hi>Decretal,</hi> which gave no ſatisfaction neither, but from time to time as the Popes advanced in Authority, they framed new Rules for themſelves, ſo that in the matter of Benefices, neither the <hi>Decree,</hi> nor the <hi>Decretal,</hi> nor the <hi>Sesto</hi> have any more Room, but other Rules as ſhall be ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>The great Method which the <hi>Court of Rome</hi> uſed in beſtowing of ſo many Benefices, drew thither all ſorts of Clergy-men, thoſe who had none to gain ſome, and thoſe who had, to aſpire unto greater or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: So that beſides the old cauſes this alſo was added, that many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>non-Reſident;</hi> which the Court could not diſſemble, for every Dioceſs complained that the Churches were without Government,<note place="margin">N. 139.</note> and attributed the cauſe of the Evil where it truly was, wherefore 'twas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved ſome Proviſion ſhould be made for it. Therefore it ſeemed not convenient to the Popes of theſe times to proceed as formerly with Caſtigations, becauſe the diſorder was too common, as alſo becauſe it would have been a means to ſend all out of <hi>Rome,</hi> which if it ſhould have been done, the Court would have remained empty, and every one would have endeavour'd to obtain Benefices from his Biſhop, near to whom he was perſonally, rather than to ſend Salaries, and Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to <hi>Rome,</hi> for the obtaining of Expectancies or Reverſions; How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a Medium was found by making of Laws, which commanded Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidency to that ſort of Beneficed men, who could expect but little from the Court, ſpeaking nothing of others; Thus <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>3d</hi> in the year 1179, commanded Reſidency to all Beneficed Perſons who had the Cure of Souls: The 'twas added alſo, all thoſe who had Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,<note place="margin">N. 140.</note> Adminiſtrations, or Canon-ſhips; of other inferior Beneficed men 'twas never ſaid they were obliged to Refidency, and much leſs were they commanded to Reſide, wherefore by little and little they account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves not obliged to it; in ſuch manner there aroſe a Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Benefices, ſome of which <hi>required Reſidency, and others ſimply
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60809:25"/>which obliged not thereunto;</hi> wherefore the Doctors declared the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, that <hi>de Jare</hi> all are obliged unto Reſidency, not being able to ſay otherwiſe without perverting Antiquity, but through cuſtom they ſay ſingle Benefices Excepted.</p>
            <p>It was a moſt common ſaying: <hi>Beneficium datur propter Officium,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe being diſobliged from Reſidency, having no Office, it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the ſingle Benefice remained as a vain thing in the Church. For which they found a remedy by an Equivocation. The Canonical hours which at firſt were Celebrated in the Church, by all the Fraternity, and afterwards ſome made it Lawful for themſelves to ſay them privately, about the year 800, they acquired the name of <hi>Officium divinum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 141.</note> which being Celebrated by all, either in common or in private, the truth of the Propoſition was ſaved: <hi>Beneficium datur propter Officium;</hi> that is to ſay, for repeating the divine Office, not for ſerving the faithful People reſiding in the Churches, and exerciſing the charge as formerly, and this is that <hi>Officium,</hi> anſwerable unto <hi>Beneficium.</hi> Therefore the Conſcience of many Beneficed men being ſecured by this means, that they might be abſent from the Church of the Benefice, it ſeemed alſo neceſſary to find out a way that when it had been needful to cauſe any one of thoſe to remain at Court, who was obliged to Reſidency, it might be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out derogating from the Laws. Whereupon <hi>Honorius</hi> the <hi>3d</hi> about the year 1220, declared that he who was in the Popes Service, ſhould not be obliged to reſide; nothing elſe remained, but to find a way how they might take away Reſidency from ſome Rich Benefice under Cure, which failed not;<note place="margin">N. 142.</note> for it being an ordinary thing for the Parſon of the Pariſh at times when he is Lawfully hindred, to appoint a Vicar to ſerve for him, allowing him a convenient Stipend; ſo it is found, that they might (but with the Popes Authority) Create a perpetual Vicar, appointing him a ſufficient Portion, and leaving the remainder to the Rector, <hi>oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Vicar unto Reſidency,</hi> although the Rector draws the greateſt part of the Income, and remains free himſelf, whoſe ſhare becomes as a ſingle Benefice, and that of the Vicar remains for the Curates Proviſion. And as it was unknown to the Antient Church, that any Benefice was given but for the <hi>Office ſake,</hi> and therefore every one is obliged to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his <hi>Office Perſonally;</hi> ſo there was never one man deputed unto two Charges or Offices, not only for being impoſſible when they are to be exerciſed in different places, but alſo becauſe thoſe holy men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it no ſmall matter to perform one well, and there are many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, to which ancient Inſtitutions are referr'd, that one cannot be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to two Titles, nor ſerve in two Churches.<note place="margin">N. 143.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In thoſe times when Benefices were diſtinguiſhed into ſuch as have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidency, and ſuch as have not; Conſequently 'tis come to be ſaid,<note place="margin">Benefices with Reſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</note> that of thoſe, where it is not neceſſary to ſerve in ones own Perſon, a man may have more than one, and there aroſe a diſtinction of <hi>Compatible,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Benefices Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible.</note> and of <hi>Incompatible Benefices;</hi> thoſe which require Reſidency, are <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible</hi> amongſt themſelves, a man being not able to divide himſelf into different places, but theſe with others, and they amongſt themſelves are <hi>Compatible,</hi> ſeeing it is not neceſſary to ſerve Perſonally.</p>
            <p>However in the Beginning, they proceeded in this matter with great Reſpect, and went no further than to ſay only, when a Benefice was not ſufficient for the Clerks Living, he might have another <hi>Incompatible,</hi> but they never durſt go on to the third, much leſs unto the ſecond, if the firſt had been ſufficient. The Authority was never extended farther

All the Canoniſts and the Caſuiſts agree that ſuch Diſpenſes ought ſtill to be given for a Lawful Cauſe, and that the <hi>Pope</hi> ſins, if he grants them without it: But if that which is of value in the Diſpenſation granted without Lawful Cauſe, be excuſed, they do not agree.</p>
            <p>Others ſay, that it excuſeth before God, and before men; others that it ſerves to avoid the Penalty of the Canonical Laws, and that in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and before God it avails not. This opinion is followed by the moſt Godly men,<note place="margin">N. 146.</note> the firſt is moſt grateful to the Court, who is not pleaſed to have any Law impoſed which may regulate the Popes Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, chiefly in Beneficial matters; becauſe ſome of them hold alſo, though with great contention of others, that the Pope can alſo grant many cured Benefices through Diſpenſation, however they have not made uſe of that opinion, ſeeing they have found out other wayes to beſtow many cured Benefices, with Colour and Pretext which ſhould appear but one,<note place="margin">Union and Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and theſe Inventions took beginning in the times above-ſaid. One of theſe wayes is <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> the other <hi>Commendation,</hi> of which it will behoove us to ſpeak anon.</p>
            <p>'Twas a moſt Antient thing, that when a People by Accidents of War, of Plague, or by Inundation was reduced to ſuch a ſmall number that it could not ſupport the Charges for the Maintenance of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the Biſhop gave the Cure of that People unto the Neighbouring Pariſh, and together with that, applyed the ſmall Incomes, and this was called <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niting of two Pariſhes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 147.</note> In like manner when Cities were dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed or waſted, and therefore could not maintain the Biſhop conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently, the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> with the Biſhops aſſembled in Councel, gave two or more to one Biſhop, and theſe Cities were called <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited;</hi> as likewiſe on the contrary, when the number of People encreaſed, and that one man only could not ſupply all, one Cure became divided into two; yea unto theſe preſent times theſe Methods are Commendably uſed, which are for the Service of God, for Spiritual Benefit, and for conveniency of the People. But after they proceeded to make unions
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60809:26"/>alſo for the Conveniency of ſome Pious Place, by which means ſome Benefices became united to ſome Biſhoprick, or to ſome Monaſtery, or to ſome poor Hoſpital, by virtue of which union the Party Beneficyed ſeems indeed to have two Benefices, but in truth he hath but one. Humane ſubtilty invented, (being willing to give two <hi>incompatible Benefices</hi> to one Perſon) to unite the one unto the other during his Life,<note place="margin">N. 148.</note> ſo that giving him the Principal, the United was alſo given by Conſequence, by which means it ſaves very well the Law of having but one Benefice in appearance, but in the Exiſtence there is nothing but the <hi>obſervance of th words, with Tranſgreſſion of the ſenſe;</hi> The <hi>Juriſconſults</hi> call it the <hi>Fraud of the Law.</hi> This ſerved alſo that they might give a Cured Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice to a young ſtriplin or boy, or to any other illiterate Perſon, and without being obliged to receive Sacred Orders, by uniting the <hi>Cured Benefice</hi> to a <hi>ſingle one,</hi> during Life, and Confering the <hi>ſingle one</hi> in <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> the Beneficyary remained the Curates Patron alſo; and the words of the Law were very well obſerved. But the Power of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niting Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices</hi> for Life, was never granted to the Biſhops for any Cauſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, but reſerved to the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> only: Some Lawyers call it an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> in the <hi>Name,</hi> but in <hi>Fact</hi> it is a <hi>Relaxation</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and they hold it for Damnable, wherefore alſo in ſome Kingdoms it hath been prohibited. It was long uſed by the <hi>Roman Court,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 149.</note> now 'tis no more in uſe, no more than many other <hi>Cantelous</hi> things, not to call them <hi>Frauds</hi> like theſe which ſpeak too Legally for the Cauſes, as ſhall be declared when we come to our times.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Commendum</hi> had alſo a good Antient Inſtitution,<note place="margin">Commendums.</note> for when an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective Benefice</hi> became Vacant, either Biſhoprick, Abbey, or elſe a Living which was <hi>Jus Patronatus,</hi> for which the Ordinary out of ſome Reſpect could not provide immediately, the care whereof was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Superior, to ſome worthy Perſon, until Proviſion ſhould be made, nevertheleſs that Perſon had not Power to make uſe of the Incoms, but only to Govern them, and for this an Excellent man was choſen, who uſually was a Benefic'd man, to whom the recommended Cure was a burden, with which he was to be contented for the Church ſervice only. This could not be called,<note place="margin">N. 150.</note> having a Benefice recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him but very improperly; and therefore in Reality he had not two Benefices, although to make no difficulty of ſpeech, there aroſe a Maxime amongſt the <hi>Canonists,</hi> that a man might have two <hi>Benefices,</hi> the one in <hi>Title,</hi> the other in <hi>Commendum,</hi> which <hi>Commendum</hi> at firſt laſted but until Proviſion were made, afterwards they Commended for a good while, which ſometimes was long enough, wherefore the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> forbad the Biſhops from Commending for above ſix months, not making the Rule for himſelf, but by a Court Style the <hi>Commendum</hi> contracted a little Cuſtom not altogether Commendable, which was, that when the <hi>Pope</hi> had a mind to give any man a <hi>Benefice,</hi> it could not be done, either for want of Age, or becauſe the <hi>Benefice</hi> was <hi>Monacal,</hi> and the Perſon <hi>Secular,</hi> or for ſome other reſpect he Commended it to him ſo long, that he might acquire the neceſſary qualities for to have the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>But finally about the year 1350, all Reſpects being laid aſide, the Popes holding the other Biſhops ſtrictly to the Term of ſix months,<note place="margin">N. 151.</note> they Proceeded to give the <hi>Commendum for Life,</hi> which if it be given to one who hath in Title another Incompatible Benefice, he obſerves very well the words of the Law, that two Benefices cannot be given, but one in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60809:27"/>
               <hi>Title,</hi> and the other in <hi>Commendum;</hi> but the ſenſe is defrauded, becauſe that which is Commendatory for Life, as touching the Profits, is like unto the <hi>Titular;</hi> alſo giving a Benefice in <hi>Commendum</hi> to one who hath not the qualities required by the Canons, doth not diſagree with the Words thereof, but 'tis given to him in Deed, and not given to him in Words: the <hi>Commendums</hi> of <hi>Biſhopricks</hi> and other Benefices are almoſt out of uſe in <hi>Italy:</hi> There remains ſome <hi>Abbeys</hi> for the Cauſes which in our times ſhall be declared.</p>
            <p>By the means aboveſaid, the Popes drew to themſelves great ſhare of the Beneficial Diſpoſals, in all the Chriſtian Kingdoms of the <hi>West,</hi> but in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches, he was never ſuffered to diſpoſe of an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,</hi> not only in the laſt Ages of that Empire, when the <hi>Greeks</hi> were totally divided,<note place="margin">N. 152.</note> but likewiſe in the firſt Ages alſo, when they were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a Body, except that in <hi>Syria</hi> and in <hi>Greece,</hi> in the times and in the places which were under the <hi>Dominion</hi> of the <hi>French,</hi> and of the <hi>Venetians.</hi> But the <hi>Popes</hi> Letters which diſpoſed of Benefices in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner aboveſaid, although they were indeed for the moſt part obey'd, yet nevertheleſs not without ſome Complaint and Murmuring, putting it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to diſpute, whether the <hi>Pope</hi> could do this or that.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Italy</hi> none oppoſed the <hi>Pope,</hi> unleſs ſome Pious man for Reſpect of Conſcience, and for the Service of God, it being beſides profitable to the <hi>Italians,</hi> for ſuch were the <hi>Roman Courtiers,</hi> who by means of the <hi>Popes</hi> ample Authority, received Incoms from Beyond the <hi>Alps.</hi> In <hi>Spain</hi> the Prudence of that Nation in their Practice, deluded the Arts of the Court.</p>
            <p>In <hi>England,</hi> as in a Region where the Benefices were many and Rich, the <hi>Roman Courtiers</hi> made great gains, wherefore in the year 1232, a <hi>League</hi> was made in that Kingdom,<note place="margin">N. 153.</note> between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy-men, and the Souldiers, againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy-men Beneficed in that <hi>Iſland,</hi> who were ſpoyled of their Goods and Incoms; The <hi>Pope</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the King under pain of Excommunication, that he ſhould Chaſtize or Puniſh, and Perſecute them with Temporal Arms, and that the Prelates ſhould Excommunicate them; But they were found to be ſo numerous, that the King durſt not meddle with them, neither did the Prelates dare to make uſe of their Spiritual Weapons. The Affairs remained quiet for a few years, whereupon <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> a <hi>Genoéſe</hi> took freſh Courage, and ſent one <hi>Martin</hi> his Kinſman, by whoſe means he renew'd the Faſhions of the Court, upon which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had Recourſe to the King, Complaining that the <hi>Italians</hi> got Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Benefices; The King Baniſhed <hi>Martin</hi> from the Kingdom, and cauſing an Account to be made of how much the <hi>Pope</hi> drew out of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> he found it to be equal to his own Revenue, which is ſixty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Marks;</hi> The King propoſed ſome of theſe Differences to the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at Lions,</hi> making Complaint of the aboveſaid grievances, whereto the <hi>Pope</hi> anſwered, the Council was not Aſſembled for that purpoſe, and that it was no time to harken to it.</p>
            <p>In the ſaid City of <hi>Lions</hi> during the time of the Council,<note place="margin">N. 154.</note> the <hi>Pope</hi> would have given to his Kinſmen ſome Prebendaries of thoſe Churches, upon which there was a great Commotion in the City, and the <hi>Pope</hi> had notice given him, that they ſhould be thrown into the <hi>Rhone,</hi> wherefore the <hi>Pope</hi> ſent them away privately.<note place="margin">Rhodano.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For all this the <hi>Court</hi> left not off its Deſigns, but in the year 1253, the ſame <hi>Pope</hi> Commanded <hi>Robert Biſhop of Lincoln,</hi> (a man in thoſe times
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60809:27"/>Famous in Doctrine and in Goodneſs) that he ſhould confer a certain <hi>Benefice</hi> upon the <hi>Genoéſe</hi> againſt the Canons, which appearing inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and unjuſt to the Biſhop, he anſwered the <hi>Pope,</hi> that he Honour'd Apoſtolical Commands Conformable to Apoſtolical Doctrine, wherefore that <hi>non obſtantibus</hi> is a Deluge of inconſtancy, a <hi>Breach of Faith,</hi> a diſturbance of the quietneſs of Chriſtendom; that it is a grievous Sin to defraud the Sheep of their Paſture; that the Apoſtolical See had all <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>Edification, none to destroy.</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 155.</note> This Anſwer received, the <hi>Pope</hi> grew wroth exceedingly; But <hi>Cardinal Egidius</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> being a Prudent man, endeavour'd to Mitigate him, repreſenting to him, that to proceed againſt a man of ſuch Reputation, for a cauſe ſo abhorr'd by the World, could not bring forth a good Effect. But whilſt the <hi>Pope</hi> ſtudyed to ſhew his Reſentment, <hi>Robert</hi> fell ſick, and to the end of his Life held the ſame Reaſons, and dyed with an Opinion of Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and 'twas fam'd that he wrought Miracles. The <hi>Pope</hi> hearing of his Death, cauſed a Proceſs to be formed for the King, to diſ-inter the dead mans Corps: But the night following, in a Viſion or in a Dream he had <hi>Robert</hi> in <hi>Pontifical Robes,</hi> who Rebuked him for perſecuting his memory, and ſmote him on the Flank with the <hi>But-end</hi> of his <hi>Croſier-Staff:</hi> The <hi>Pope</hi> awoke with an exceſſive Pain in that Place, which afflicted him unto his Death, that happened within a ſhort time after.</p>
            <p>In the year 1258, <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> Excommunicated the <hi>Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> of <hi>York</hi> for the like Cauſe, who perſevering in his Deliberation,<note place="margin">N. 156.</note> endured the Perſecution with much Patience, and drawing neer to his Death, wrote a very Prudent Letter to the <hi>Pape,</hi> exhorting him to imitate his Holy Predeceſſors, and to take away the Dammageable Novelties from the Church, and from his own Soul; He dyed with the Opinion of a Saint and a Martyr.</p>
            <p>In theſe times 'twas likewiſe neceſſary in <hi>France,</hi> to make a Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which I ſhall relate after having given notice, that for theſe and for other Impediments which the Princes and the Biſhops oppoſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the endeavours of the Court, which never thought of giving o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: For <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> in the year 1266, reſolved to lay the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, whereby he, or his Succeſſors, might declare themſelves to be <hi>abſolute Patrons</hi> in all the Collations of Benefices throughout the World, and remove the neceſſity of finding out Wayes and Arts to draw the Collations unto <hi>Rome,</hi> and made a <hi>Bull,</hi> which concluded nothing elſe but the <hi>Reſervation</hi> of the <hi>Vacanti in Curia,</hi> ſaying, that the Collation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them by an Antient Cuſtom is reſerved to the Pope, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he approved of this Cuſtom, and wil'd it to be obſerved;<note place="margin">N. 157.</note> But to conclude this alone; So much an <hi>Hyppothetical Premium</hi> can do, in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that although the plenary Diſpoſal of all Benefices,<note place="margin">Premio Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetico.</note> belongs to the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo that he may not only confer them when they become Vacant, but he may alſo before Vacancy grant a Right for the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them; Nevertheleſs the Antient Cuſtom hath more eſpecially reſerved the <hi>Vacanti in Curia;</hi> Wherefore we approve of that Cuſtom. If the <hi>Pope</hi> had made a concluding Edict, that the Diſpoſal of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices belonged to him, the World would have ſtir'd in it, and as well the Clergy-men as Princes, and other Lay-Patrons would have declared their Reaſons. But this Propoſition being put into a Conditional with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Concluſion, went on eaſily without any notice taken of how much it might Import. But two years after, that is, in the year 1268,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60809:28"/>without having any Reſpect unto this <hi>Bull,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 158.</note> 
               <hi>St. Lewis King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> ſeeing that the Proviſions made by the Queen Regent his Mother, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Minority, and during his Abſence in the Holy Land, were not ſufficient to remove the Confuſions introduced in the matter of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices,<note place="margin">Pragmatic Sanction.</note> made his famous <hi>Pragmatick,</hi> wherein he Commanded, that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Churches</hi> ſhould have their Elections Free, and the Monaſteries likewiſe, that all other Benefices ſhould be given according to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Law, and that no Impoſition of the <hi>Court of Rome</hi> could be levied upon Benefices without his Conſent, and the Churches of his Kingdom.

Wherefore if when 'twas Lawful by the Laws of the Prince, for the Churches to purchaſe Eſtates in Land,<note place="margin">N. 164.</note> they might retain thoſe which were given or bequeathed, 'twas therefore in the <hi>Biſhops</hi> Liberty, not only to make uſe of the Incomes, but alſo to ſell the very Eſtates to diſcharge the neceſſary Expences in Maintaining the Miniſters and the Poor, as alſo to give or beſtow according to Exigencies; And the Authority of Diſpenſator granted to the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> did not extend to the Fruits only, as at preſent, but alſo unto the Eſtate it ſelf, and to other <hi>Chapters,</hi> which at firſt was Adminiſtred with Sincerity, ſo that there aroſe no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency thereby, and laſted a long time in Poor Churches, where the Eſtates being but ſmall, and the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of no great Authority, there was no matter or cauſe of Tranſgreſſion: But in Rich Churches, and great ones, where the Reputation Emboldened the <hi>Biſhops</hi> to attempt that which would not have been permitted unto all, and Abundance gave matter of being able to make uſe of ſome part Arbitrarily, the <hi>Biſhops</hi> began to exceed the Bounds of Modeſty, from Diſpenſing, they came to Diſſipating, againſt which it was requiſite to provide; neither the Proviſion proceeded not from the Clergy-men, but from Secular men, to whoſe prejudice it was;<note place="margin">N. 165.</note> For the Publick Eſtate of the Church
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60809:29"/>being leſſened, the Clergy were not ſuffered to take their Living, who were the firſt, but the Poor who remained to the laſt.</p>
            <p>In the moſt Principal Churches, which were <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> the Proviſion was alſo firſt neceſſary, wherefore <hi>Leo the Emperor,</hi> by a Law of his, <hi>Anno.</hi> 470, Prohibited the Church of <hi>Constantinople</hi> from every Alienation, and in the year 483, <hi>Baſilius Cecina Praefect us Praetorius</hi> of King <hi>Odoacre</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Simplicius</hi> being Vacant, by a Decree made in the Church, Ordained that the Eſtate of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church</hi> ſhould not be Alienated, which was not found ſtrange by three Succeeding <hi>Popes,</hi> but in the year 502, <hi>Odoacre</hi> being extinct, and all his Power, <hi>Simmacus</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> Aſſembled a Councel of all <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> wherein he propoſed as a great Abſurdity, that a <hi>Lay-man</hi> ſhould have made Conſtitutions in the <hi>Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 166.</note> and by Conſent of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel declared them Null: But leſt it ſhould appear that this would tend to diſorder, a Decree was made in the Councel, that the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and the other Miniſters of that Church, ſhould not be able to Alienate, ſpecifying that the Decree ſhould not oblige other Churches, but the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> only.</p>
            <p>The following times ſhewed there was need of the ſame Law in all the Churches, wherefore <hi>Anastaſius</hi> extended <hi>Leo's Law</hi> to all the Churches ſubject to the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to all which he Prohibited the Power of Alienating.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Justinian the Emperor,</hi> in the year 535, made a <hi>Constitution Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> for all the <hi>Eaſtern, Western,</hi> and <hi>African Churches,</hi> and alſo for <hi>all Pious Places,</hi> Prohibiting the Power of Alienating, excepting only to Feed the Poor in caſe of extraordinary Famine, and to releaſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, in which Caſes Alienation was granted Conformable to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Cuſtom,<note place="margin">N. 167.</note> of which <hi>St. Ambroſe</hi> makes mention, that not only Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, but alſo the Veſſels were ſold for ſuch Cauſes. <hi>Justinian's Law</hi> in the <hi>Weſt</hi> was obſerved in following times, until that <hi>Rome</hi> remained under the <hi>Eastern Empire,</hi> and there are many Epiſtles of <hi>St. Gregories,</hi> which make mention of Eſtates Alienated for the Redemption of Slaves. But from the times of <hi>Pelagius the 2d,</hi> unto <hi>Adrian the 1st,</hi> for 200 years the Expence was incredible which the <hi>Roman Church</hi> made for to recompence it ſelf on the <hi>Lumbards,</hi> as well to cauſe them to raiſe the Sieges, as that they ſhould not moleſt the Country, and <hi>St. Gregory</hi> gives good Teſtimony of it in his time: The Doctrine which runs at preſent was not then in Credit, that Eccleſiaſtical Eſtates are exempt from Common neceſſities, but quite Contrary; thoſe were the firſt that were to be expended before they came to lay Contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon private Houſes.</p>
            <p>Much leſs did it ever come into thought of putting into Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie the Authority of Princes, about making Laws; becauſe beſides the perpetual obſervance,<note place="margin">N. 168.</note> there was the ſolid Foundation, that theſe were the Churches Goods, that is, belonging to the Common, and to the Congregation of the Faithful, ſo that it concerned the proper Office of the <hi>Prince,</hi> to procure the Conſervation of them.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, when the <hi>Empire</hi> was Eſtabliſhed on <hi>Charlemain,</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Laws</hi> remaining without Authority, the abuſe returned, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on divers <hi>Prohibitions</hi> were made by divers Councels,<note place="margin">Prohibitions.</note> chiefly in <hi>France</hi> where the Diſſipation was greater.</p>
            <p>But after that, the <hi>Roman Popes</hi> had aſſumed the greateſt ſhare of the Government of other Churches, ſeeing that a General Prohibition
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60809:29"/>wrought but little Effect, the Prelates wanting no Pretexts, to except every particular caſe from the Common Law, they made divers Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances from the year 1000, unto the year 1250, preſcribing certain little Forms of Solemnity, which ſerved for a Bridle, and for an Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment. But in this time whereof we ſpeak, <hi>Innocent the 4th,</hi> began to declare <hi>Null</hi> the Alienations made without thoſe Conditions,<note place="margin">N. 169.</note> and <hi>Gregory the 10th,</hi> in the <hi>Councel</hi> at <hi>Lions Anno.</hi> 1274, Ordained they ſhould not be able to Alienate, without leave from the <hi>Pope,</hi> beſides the Solemnities aboveſaid alſo; which hath been obſerved, and is ſtill obſerved unto our dayes, never granting any Alienation but upon evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Utility, which hath not wanted for thoſe who have noted it for an expreſs Iniquity, ſeeing that in Contracts never any man ſeeks for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than for Equality, and more cannot be, but with detriment to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, ſpecially the <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> to ſpecify what thing this Utility ought to be, which the Church ought to receive in Alienation, ſome ſay it ought to be the <hi>Fourth part,</hi> others the <hi>Third part</hi> of the Value; So that they quite left off ſelling, to feed the Poor in time of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Famine, or to redeem Captives, it being Interpreted to be a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and not an Utility to the Church. Thus things are turned about, that which heretofore was a work of a high Perfection in Chriſtians, as ſelling, and giving to the Poor,<note place="margin">N. 170.</note> would now be ſubject to grievous Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, but Perfection is in retaining Eccleſiaſtical Eſtates, which much leſs cannot be exchanged without Evident Utility,<note place="margin">Abuſe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions.</note> and the <hi>Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> for Alienating, which were made againſt the Clergy-men, in favour of the Laity, are turned about againſt the Laity, in favour of the Clergy.</p>
            <p>But returning to the Declaration of <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> and <hi>5th,</hi> and to the Common Doctrine, that the Pope may Concur, and prevent every Collator of <hi>Benefices,</hi> this was of no great Profit, ſaving in the Vacant <hi>Benefices</hi> of the Neighbouring places to the Court, ſo that the Vacancy might be ſpeedily known there, for as touching thoſe at a Diſtance, his being able to Concur, or to prevent, was of little uſe, becauſe before it could be known at Court, the Proviſion was made by the Ordinary, and had iſſued the Effect, or caſt Lots: Wherefore 'twas invented, that which became a total Mutation in the matter of <hi>Benefices,</hi> and deſtroys totally the Antient Inſtitution of all the Catholick Church,<note place="margin">Reſervations.</note> this is the <hi>Reſervation,</hi> which is a <hi>Decree whereby the Pope declares before a Benefice becomes Vacant, that when it ſhall be Vacant, no man ſhall confer it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 171.</note> 
               <hi>and the Collation which any one ſhall make, is to be of none Effect.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is an odious matter as the <hi>Gloſs</hi> ſaith well, to make it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the World, and ſwallowed down ſweetly, 'twas in its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning uſed ſparingly, by reaſon the abſolute Reſervation ſeemed too hard, which <hi>Clement the 4th</hi> had made of the <hi>Vacanti in Curia,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Gregory the 10th</hi> reſtrained it to a month only, permitting the ordinary Proviſions might be made after that. <hi>Clement the 5th</hi> added thereunto the Reſervation of the <hi>Cathedral Church,</hi> and of <hi>St. Cros</hi>'s Monaſtery in <hi>Bordeaux</hi> for once; <hi>Pope John the 22d,</hi> his Succeſſor ſtretcht the Step a little further, and made a Conſtitution to Reform the <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality</hi> of <hi>Benefices,</hi> Prohibiting the keeping of more than one Curate, and another without a Cure with Diſpenſation, excepting the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> Commanding that he who had more, ſhould reſign them,<note place="margin">N. 172.</note> and for the future that he who had one Cured <hi>Benefice,</hi> and ſhould receive ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was to reſign up the Firſt, and thoſe which were reſigned, ſhould
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60809:30"/>be reſerved to his Diſpoſal; The <hi>Bull</hi> for the apparent end of taking away the Plurality of <hi>Benefices,</hi> was a ſpecious Reſervation, though it had no other end than the Profit of the Court, paſſed away as a thing acceſſory, and which ſeemed at firſt ſight without Burthen, becauſe as yet the end whereto it tended was not diſcovered.</p>
            <p>Here 'tis neceſſary to make a little Halt, becauſe this <hi>Pope</hi> gave many Examples unto his Succeſſors for the Collationing of <hi>Benefices,</hi> which ſerved to <hi>heap up Treaſures:</hi> He divided many Biſhopricks, and when a Rich <hi>Benefice</hi> became Vacant, he was wont to give it to a man who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready had another ſomewhat inferior to it, giving that which was Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant to another, prevailing ſo far in this manner, that ſometimes for one Vacant, he made ſix Proviſions or Promotions, by transferring alwayes from one leſs Rich,<note place="margin">N. 173.</note> to another more Rich, and by providing the leaſt or Pooreſt with a new Beneficiated; ſo that all were Contented and all paid.<note place="margin">Annatae.</note> He invented alſo the <hi>Annatae</hi> or <hi>firſt Fruits,</hi> a burthen upon Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices never heard of before him, and which for ſometimes Created ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great Scandals. When <hi>Emperors</hi> or <hi>Kings</hi> Conferr'd any <hi>Benefices,</hi> if thoſe who aſpired to them made any Donative, or elſe Contracted with the Prince or with his Miniſters, to give any ſhare of the Fruits and Incomes of the <hi>Benefices</hi> for to Obtain them, this was then moſt ſharply rebuked by the <hi>Popes,</hi> who called it an unlawful thing, alledging the Goſpel; <hi>Gratis accepistis, gratis date,</hi> and calling the Receit of gifts, or of a part of the Fruits, a ſale of Spiritual things, and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract by <hi>Symonie,</hi> ſome proceeding to call it <hi>Hereſie,</hi> though ſome were not wanting in thoſe times to give their Opinion, and ſay, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of Chriſt, and the Authority of <hi>looſing</hi> and <hi>binding</hi> was a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thing from the Poſſeſſion of Temporal things annexed to a <hi>Benefice,</hi> and that by reaſon of this Temporality, it was not diſagreeing, that the Prince ſhould receive ſome ſhare for the neceſſities of the Common Wealth,<note place="margin">N. 174.</note> and of this a Solemn Diſpute was alſo made.</p>
            <p>But this Anſwer ſatisfied not Pious and learned men; for although the Revenue of <hi>Benefices</hi> be a Temporal thing, yet the Right and Title by which they are Poſſeſſed, is a Spiritual thing: It appeared to all men, and ſtill it doth appear, that with good Reaſons theſe Methods of the <hi>Popes</hi> were reproved, and called <hi>Simony.</hi> This Defect was made uſe of for the firſt Pretext for taking away the <hi>Collation</hi> of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices</hi> from <hi>Princes.</hi> But the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> having by the Progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes above written, gained great part of the Power whereof the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors were ſpoyled; <hi>John</hi> the <hi>22d, Anno.</hi> 1316. Ordained that for three years, every man who Obtained a <hi>Benefice</hi> of a greater Income than 24 <hi>Ducats,</hi> ought at the Expedition of his <hi>Bull</hi> pay a <hi>years Revenue;</hi> The three years being expired,<note place="margin">N. 175.</note> the ſame was continued as well by him, as by his Succeſſors, although ſome Reſiſtance was made in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and in ſome others they were received to pay <hi>half a years Rent</hi> only, and in other places a certain ſort of <hi>Benefices,</hi> was only obliged to pay, the others remaining excepted.</p>
            <p>The bringing in of this, was accounted very Burdenſome to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Families, the years Revenue being paid by the Beneficyed or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent out of the Houſhold Stock, there being a Hazard that he may dye before he makes good that money to the Family, and Princes found it a great grievance to their Government, ſuch a notable ſhare of the Caſh being drawn out of their Dominion, without receiving any Profit for it, and ſo much the more grievous, as this Work is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60809:30"/>with the Expence of <hi>Bulls, Diſpenſations,</hi> and <hi>Preſents</hi> or <hi>Gifts</hi> beforehand, all which carry away the Money which is the ſinew of Potency, and it never returns as it doth by way of other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</p>
            <p>When this <hi>Novelty</hi> was introduced by the <hi>Pope,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 176.</note> the ordinary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons could not perceive what difference there was betwixt this Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that which was ſo much blamed in thoſe dayes when Princes beſtowed Benefices, but learned men in thoſe primitive times Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it univerſally, as ſavouring too much of <hi>Simony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Progreſs of time, ſome men ſtudied wayes to juſtify it, ſo that they were divided, one ſort rebuking it as a thing unlawful, Simonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and forbidden by Divine and by Humane Laws, others Commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as a thing Lawful, yea neceſſary and due to the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> theſe proceeding ſo far as to defend that the <hi>Pope</hi> may not only demand a years Fruits, but more alſo, as he that is abſolute Patron, yea of all the Fruits, not of one part only, who they alſo ſay cannot commit Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for any Contract he ſhall make in the Collation of <hi>Benefices;</hi> And certainly if he were Patron as they ſay, the Conſequence would be clear, becauſe every man may Contract for his own, in what manner ſeems beſt to him, without doing wrong to any one;<note place="margin">N. 177.</note> but neither God nor the World ſeem to conſent to it. This <hi>Pope</hi> was ſo intent in drawing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from every thing, that it twenty years <hi>Popedom,</hi> he heaped up an incredible Treaſure: Certain it is, that in his Expences, and Gifts, he was no more ſtraightned than his Predeceſſors, and yet he left 25 <hi>Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> at his Death. <hi>John Villano</hi> relates that to one of his Brethren of the Colledge of Cardinals after the <hi>Popes</hi> Death, Charge was given to make an Inventory of the Mony, which he found to be 18 <hi>Millions</hi> in Coyned Mony, and ſeven <hi>Millions</hi> in Veſſels and in Ingots weighed by him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First year Fruits</hi> in his Inſtitution from <hi>Pope John</hi> the <hi>22d,</hi>
               <note place="margin">L'Annata.</note> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended but unto <hi>Benefices</hi> which were Conferr'd, and which were paid for in the Expedition of <hi>Bulls,</hi> a thing which Continued unto that time; but afterwards there was alſo laid an Obligation upon all <hi>Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> to pay the <hi>first year Fruits</hi> or Revenue every 15 <hi>years,</hi> becauſe that being united unto <hi>Monasteries, Hoſpitals,</hi> or to <hi>Pious places,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 178.</note> they never become <hi>Vacant,</hi> which Impoſition was therefore called <hi>Quinden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Quindennium.</note> which <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>2d</hi> about the year 1470, Conſtituted only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Benefices</hi> united after the year 1417, by the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> extended or enlarged it likewiſe to all the <hi>Benefices</hi> united before, and <hi>Sixtus</hi> the <hi>5th</hi> Comprehended not only thoſe united by the <hi>Apostolical See,</hi> but alſo thoſe which had been united by <hi>Legates, Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio's, Biſhops,</hi> and by others.</p>
            <p>But returning to the firſt Original of theſe <hi>year Incoms or Fruits,</hi> thoſe who oppoſed againſt the Invention of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>22d,</hi> with zeal of hindring that the <hi>year-Fruits</hi> might paſs no further, they have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought about his Deſign, but have been the Cauſe of defending and extending it alſo; even as ſome who then oppoſed the <hi>Reſervation,</hi> brought forth a contrary Effect, the <hi>Popes</hi> never failing to get any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe whatever to be Juſtifyed by Doctrines; Wherefore after this <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictus</hi> the <hi>12th, Anno</hi> 1335, under pretence of being willing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide or furniſh Livings with fitting Perſons, he reſerved to his own Diſpoſal and Providing for his Life time only, all the <hi>Benefices Vacant in Curia,</hi> as had been done formerly,<note place="margin">N. 179.</note> and alſo all thoſe which became
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60809:31"/>Vacant by <hi>Privation</hi> of thoſe who were <hi>Beneficiated,</hi> or elſe by <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> unto another <hi>Benefice,</hi> and alſo all thoſe which were <hi>renounced</hi> in the Court, and all the <hi>Benefices</hi> of <hi>Cardinals,</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi> Officers, of <hi>Legates, Nuncio's,</hi> and of other <hi>Rectors,</hi> and <hi>Treaſurers</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church-Lands,</hi> likewiſe the Benefices of thoſe who went to Court up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Buſineſs, if in going or coming they happened to die within 40 miles Diſtance of the Court, and likewiſe all thoſe which became Vacant becauſe the Poſſeſſors of them had received another <hi>Benefice.</hi> Theſe <hi>Reſervations</hi> Comprehended a multitude of <hi>Benefices,</hi> reſtraining much the Power of the Ordinaries, and they cauſed many <hi>Benefices</hi> to be ſetled upon Forrainers, this was received however becauſe the <hi>Reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was only for during his Life. Yet 'tis never to be believed that a thing uſeful to him that Governs, inſtituted for ſome ſhort ſpace of time,<note place="margin">N. 180.</note> ſhould remain Circumſcribed thereby; For <hi>Benedictus</hi> the <hi>12th</hi> being dead, <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>6th</hi> his Succeſſor made the ſame <hi>Reſerve;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England, Edward</hi> the <hi>3d</hi> perceiving that for this Cauſe and by reaſon of Reverſions, all the <hi>Benefices</hi> of the Kingdom fell unto Forrainers. He Commanded upon pain of Death that the <hi>Popes</hi> Beneficyal Proviſions ſhould not be received within his Kingdom. The <hi>Pope</hi> wrote to the <hi>King,</hi> ſhewing ſorrow for it, deſiring he would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear. The <hi>King</hi> anſwered beſeeching the <hi>Pope</hi> to Reform the things which were a ſhame to the Church, and a ſcandal to the People: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding further that his Predeceſſors had Enriched the Churches, which by the Proviſions and Impoſitions of <hi>Rome</hi> are Poſſeſſed by Strangers and unworthy men, contrary to the mind and intention of the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, whereby the Kingdom alſo became weakened, That the <hi>Pope</hi> ought to <hi>feed</hi> and not <hi>ſhear</hi> the <hi>Sheep,</hi> that heretofore the Kings gave the <hi>Benefices,</hi> that they have granted the Election unto the Clergy, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Popes Petition,</hi> and now the <hi>Popes</hi> will take away the Election introduced by them,<note place="margin">N. 181.</note> and uſurp it to themſelves. Wherefore 'twill be convenient to return to the firſt Inſtitution, that <hi>Benefices</hi> are to be conferr'd by Princes.</p>
            <p>This Contention which laſted while the <hi>Pope</hi> was living, was occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that <hi>Innocent</hi> the <hi>6th</hi> Succeſſor to <hi>Clement</hi> revoked all his Reſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by a Conſtitution of his, which begins: <hi>PASTORALIS.</hi> The ſame at preſent is not to be found, but many famous <hi>Canonists</hi> make mention of it, the like hath happened to many others, whereby the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes, and the Uſurpations would be made manifeſt, as in like manner all things were taken out of the <hi>Gloſſes,</hi> which favour'd not the <hi>Court,</hi> but the <hi>expurgatory Index</hi>'s made with the Doctors ſhew worſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the fitting them for his Intereſts or purpoſes before they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <hi>to the Preſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But few years after they were reſtored again, wherefore <hi>Edward An.</hi> 1373, ſent an Ambaſſador to <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>11th,</hi> at <hi>Avignon,</hi> making Inſtance that the Reſervations ſhould be quite annull'd. The Buſineſs was taken in hand,<note place="margin">N. 182.</note> which laſted two years, at laſt in the year 1375, the <hi>Pope</hi> Annull'd them totally.</p>
            <p>But he being dead, the beginning of the great Schiſm happened in the year 1378, by which there being <hi>two Popes,</hi> there were alſo <hi>two Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Courts,</hi> and the Expences or Charges were Duplicated, and thoſe alſo were much greater than Ordinary, through the neceſſities of ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which the <hi>Popes</hi> had for the Perſecuting of one another, and for the defending themſelves againſt one another, whereby each of them
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60809:31"/>ſet on foot all the wayes imaginable for the raiſing of Money, and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> was moſt manifeſt in each of the Courts, <hi>Benefices</hi> being freely ſold, and they took all they could out of the Hands of the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Roman Court</hi> had not openly diſcovered it ſelf until this time, for they aimed at nothing elſe but at <hi>Money,</hi> of all their undertakings the Cauſe was rendred with ſome appearance or ſhew of providing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the Churches than the Ordinaries did, or elſe of providing ſome deſerving Perſon with a <hi>Benefice.</hi> But <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the <hi>6th</hi> declared himſelf why 'twas introduced into <hi>Benefices</hi> with Ordaining,<note place="margin">N. 183.</note> that the <hi>Impetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> ſhould be Invalid, if mention were not made of the value of the <hi>Benefice.</hi> Heretofore the <hi>Benefice</hi> was chiefly given for Spiritual things, the Temporals became Acceſſories, then of the Spirituals there was no mention made, the Charge or Office was not Conſidered; but the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molument.</p>
            <p>The ſame Inſtitution laſted alſo unto our dayes, and Authority being given to <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s, to Confer ſome of the leſſer <hi>Benefices,</hi> by the value of the Incomes it is determined which are the great, and which are the little ones: And in the <hi>Reſervation</hi> of <hi>Monasteries</hi> there is no care of the Spiritual, thoſe are Reſerved which exceed the value of 200 <hi>Crowns,</hi> and the inferior ones left free. This ſerves to the end, the Chamber may receive the <hi>Annata</hi> or <hi>Fruits</hi> more exactly, for if two men impetrate one <hi>Benefice,</hi> and one of them expreſſes the value to be greater than the other, the <hi>Bulls</hi> or <hi>Papal Breives</hi> of him that expreſt the leſs, will be in vain, and thoſe of the greater will be attained.</p>
            <p>Some ſay this is an expoſing it to a ſale or out-cry, and giving to whom bids moſt, others ſay it is to the end the Chamber may not be defrauded of its Right,<note place="margin">N. 184.</note> but this Conſideration belongs to the Chapter of <hi>First-Fruits.</hi>

            <p>Coming back to the time of the Schiſm, no man denyes but the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders in the <hi>Roman Courts</hi> were great, which encreaſed alſo the more, becauſe ſome Kingdoms and Provinces, Scandalized at ſuch various and different Methods, they reduced themſelves to acknowledge neither of the two <hi>Popes,</hi> whereupon it behooved them to raiſe and receive from thoſe which remained, as much as from all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Germany</hi> refuſed to remain Subject to the <hi>Reſervations</hi> and <hi>Expectan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> or <hi>Reverſions,</hi> and the Ordinaries Conferr'd <hi>Benefices</hi> without any Regard to the Ordinances of <hi>Rome.</hi> On the Contrary <hi>Innocent</hi> the <hi>7th</hi> for this Cauſe in the year 1359, ſent a <hi>Legate</hi> into <hi>Germany,</hi> to give new <hi>Bulls</hi> or <hi>Papal</hi> Letters to thoſe who were gotten in by the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Collation, paying them for them, and to cauſe them to make Compoſition for the Fruits received, leaving ſome part unto the Chamber,<note place="margin">N. 185.</note> but by this means much Money being like to go out of <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Emperor Charles</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> oppoſed it, and Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Extraction, ſaying, 'twas requiſite to Reform the <hi>Customs</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> not the <hi>Purſes.</hi> All theſe Confuſions encreaſed more and more when there came on the <hi>third Pope</hi> in the year 1409, to whom although the <hi>French</hi> did adhere, and yielded Obedience, nevertheleſs they ſtuck cloſe to one of the <hi>Kings Edicts</hi> made 3 years before, by which they Prohibited the <hi>Reſervations,</hi> the <hi>first-Fruits,</hi> and other exactions of the Court, until that by a Lawful general Councel might be provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for.</p>
            <pb n="64" facs="tcp:60809:32"/>
            <p>The King was not very Capable of the Government, but <hi>Lewis Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans</hi> who Governed him, was Author of all the Edicts, wherefore he being <hi>Kill'd</hi> 'twas eaſie for <hi>Pope John</hi> the <hi>23d</hi> to regain Authority for Conferring <hi>Benefices</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> giving to the <hi>King,</hi> to the <hi>Queen,</hi> to the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> and to the Houſe of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> the nomination of moſt of their Servants, and then prevailing with the Remainder, preſerv'd it until the Death of that King, wherefore <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>7th</hi> his Son who Succeeded him,<note place="margin">N. 186.</note> renew'd the <hi>Edicts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Italy</hi> alſo there were made ſeveral Proviſions by divers States in different manners, all which tended to take away the Abuſes. <hi>Baldus</hi> teſtifies that as much as the <hi>Bologneſes</hi> made Beneficyal Proviſions, and Particularly Ordained that they ſhould not be Conferr'd, ſaving only upon the Natives of that City, and of the Country belonging to it, neither were the Popes much eſteemed by them, for <hi>John</hi> the <hi>23d</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Florence</hi> with his Court, a certain diſorder aroſe about the Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Benefice,</hi> for which that Common-wealth deprived him of the Power of Conferring <hi>Benefices</hi> in their State for five years.</p>
            <p>In theſe times were invented inextricable Clauſes to be put into <hi>Bulls,</hi> as making a difference between Petitions Signed by <hi>Conceſſum,</hi> and thoſe which are Signed by <hi>Fiat,</hi> between the diſpatches with the Clauſe <hi>Motu Proprio</hi> with others,<note place="margin">New tricks and devices ſound out.</note> and the Clauſe <hi>Anteferri,</hi> which makes the better Conditions, from which Invention ſeveral <hi>Bulls</hi> were Obtained upon the ſaid <hi>Benefice,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 187.</note> and beſides the more Fruits paid, there aroſe Law-ſuits alſo, which were to be handled at <hi>Rome,</hi> with the Benefit of the Court. There was added, the Conſtituting of another Antagoniſt at Law, if he dyed, that the end of him might not be the end of the Law-ſuit, but by his Death there was taken or received another years Revenue, and the Continuation of the Law-ſuit, which Multiplying alſo, the Clauſes were invented, <hi>Si alteri: Si neutri: Si nulli:</hi> Whereby the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice</hi> was given to a third man alſo, but only during the Law-ſuit or Conteſt of the two firſt, which Conſtrained Princes, for the Remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Confuſions, Diſorders, and Contentions amongſt their Subjects, to bring back to the Secular Bar, or Court, the Cognizance of the <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſorio</hi> of the <hi>Benefices,</hi> a thing, which although Legitimate, had been by the Connivance of Princes taken away from the Secular Magiſtrates, and Aſſumed by the Eccleſiaſtical Court.</p>
            <p>From the Proviſions which were made by ſome Princes to ſtop the new Introductions into matters Beneficial within their Dominions,<note place="margin">N. 188.</note> the Court took occaſion to invent others, as well to work the ſame Effects under other Pretexts, as to Multiply methods whereby they might do, and therewith ſupply what they could not do, where Proviſion was made.</p>
            <p>In theſe times <hi>Reſignations</hi> were found out, not good and Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable ones,<note place="margin">Reſignations.</note> for they are very Antient, but certain others, which the World at preſent Commends not.</p>
            <p>It was never Lawful for him, who was put into an Eccleſiaſtical Charge, to leave it of his own Authority, and it was very agreeable that he who had dedicated himſelf to a Miniſtery, and had received the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for it, which was the <hi>Benefice,</hi> ſhould perſevere Adminiſtring, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs for ſome Lawful Cauſes it might happen to be neceſſary, or at leaſt for the Publick, or for the Private good, that ſome one might deveſt himſelf of it, 'twas introduced for a Cuſtom that it might be, and with the Authority of the Superior for ſome Lawful Cauſe, he may
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60809:32"/>renounce; and the Cauſes wherein 'twas practized were, if through In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of mind or of Body, or became incapable by old Age,<note place="margin">N. 189.</note> or if by enmity of Potent Perſons on the place, he could not make his Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency without Danger. When the <hi>Renunciation</hi> was received by the Biſhop, the <hi>Benefice</hi> was eſteemed as <hi>Vacant,</hi> and he to whom the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation belonge'd Conferr'd it in the ſame manner, as if it had been <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant</hi> by Death. The <hi>Renunciat</hi> was introduced in theſe times, not for any urgent Cauſe, but only to bring to paſs that the <hi>Benefice</hi> might be Conferr'd upon one nominated by the <hi>Renunciator,</hi> and as unto a new thing, it behooved alſo to give it a new Name, calling it <hi>Reſignatio ad favorem,</hi> becauſe it was only made to favour the Reſignation, that he might have the <hi>Benefice,</hi> 'tis indeed at the Superiors Liberty, to receive the Renunciation or not, but he cannot receive it, but by giving the <hi>Benefice</hi> to the Perſon Nominated.</p>
            <p>Although this was a way for introducing Hereditary Succeſſion unto <hi>Benefices,</hi> and therefore Dammageable unto the Eccleſiaſtical Order,<note place="margin">N. 190.</note> it proved more profitable to the Court, by how much the more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Benefice</hi> was Conferr'd, and by it the <hi>first-Fruits</hi> Receiv'd. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs and other Worldly Affections taught many to crave for, and to receive <hi>Benefices,</hi> not with a mind to continue in them, but with thoughts of enjoying them until they could obtain better, or elſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til ſome deſign of Marriage, or other kind of Life were brought about, or elſe until ſome Youth might come of Age, at which he might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards renounce, a thing which by Pious men was never excuſed, and 'tis held for a Common Opinion, that whoſoever receives a <hi>Benefice</hi> with a deſign of Renouncing it, cannot with a good Conſcience receive the Fruits, which ſome of a larger Conſcience, they do not mean ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of all, but of thoſe only who do it with an intent to forſake the Clerical Order.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Renouncings ad Favorem,</hi> which became Emoluments to the Receiver, the Court that the Fruit might be all its own, Prohibited the Biſhops from receiving ſuch Renouncings, and reſerved that the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> only was able to do it.<note place="margin">N. 191.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe many <hi>Beneficed</hi> men when they felt themſelves near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death, made themſelves a Succeſſor by ſuch a way, 'twas Ordained by a Rule of <hi>Chancery,</hi> that the Renouncing made in favour of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by a ſick <hi>Beneficed</hi> man ſhould not be of value, unleſs the Renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer Survived twenty dayes after Conſent granted.</p>
            <p>In theſe times the Fountain of the Oblations of the Faithful, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be drained or leſſened already while the <hi>War</hi> of the <hi>Holy Land</hi> laſted, and afterwards for ſome years, whilſt there was hopes that it might be renew'd, through which means much Gold came unto the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Order, but all hopes being loſt, the Oblations were ſtopt: Nevertheleſs Example was taken by this work, and the giving <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, Remiſſions,</hi> and <hi>Conceſſions</hi> introduced for thoſe who would lay hold on, and Contribute thereunto by ſome good and Pious work, for daily there were new works Inſtituted for each City,<note place="margin">N. 192.</note> for which <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> was granted from <hi>Rome;</hi> this brought forth much Fruit to the Clerical Order, and to the Court which did partake of it, and this went ſo far that in the year 1517, there ſprang up in <hi>Germany</hi> the Novelty which every one knows.<note place="margin">Helping hand</note> 
               <hi>Pope Pius</hi> the <hi>5th</hi> Provided for our Age by a Conſtitution, whereby he Annull'd all the <hi>Indulgences</hi> granted by the Clauſe of <hi>Helping-hands, that is,</hi> with Obligation to <hi>offer Money,</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:60809:33"/>a thing which hath not yet ſtopt the Courſe of this Harveſt.</p>
            <p>For although <hi>Indulgences</hi> are now given without that Condition, nevertheleſs in Churches are ſet forth Cheſts, and Trunks, and the People believe no Pardon to be Obtained, unleſs they Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</p>
            <p>But returning to theſe years of the Schiſm, for what Concerns the gaining or acquiring of new Incomes, and ſetled Eſtates for the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, the hope ſeem'd to be quite loſt. The <hi>Monks</hi> already <hi>had no more Credit of Holyneſs,</hi> the Fervency of the <hi>Sacred Militia</hi> not only <hi>Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm,</hi> but Extinct. The <hi>Fryars Mendicants,</hi> (for all were inſtituted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the year 1200) had therefore Credit,<note place="margin">N. 193.</note> becauſe they had totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted themſelves of the Power of Purchaſing Eſtates, and made a vow to live upon Oblations only, and Alms; whereby it appeared that the Augmentation of ſetled Eſtates would Ceaſe, but a good way was found out, which was the granting to the <hi>Mendicant Fryars</hi> by a Priviledge from the Apoſtolick See, to be able to purchaſe Eſtates, which by Vow and by Inſtitution was Forbidden them, many of their devout Perſons were moſt ready to Enrich them, there wanted nothing but the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how, this found out, immediately the <hi>Convents</hi> of <hi>Mendicants</hi> in <hi>Italy, Spain,</hi> and other Kingdoms were become very Commodious in Eſtates within a ſhort time. <hi>France</hi> only Oppoſed this Novelty, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that as they were come into the Kingdom with thoſe Inſtitutions of Poverty, it behooved they ſhould perſevere in the ſame, neither would they ſuffer them hitherto to purchaſe, whereas in ſome other places their Acquiſitions have been very Notable, chiefly in the times of the Schiſm,<note place="margin">N. 194.</note> when all the Remainder of the Clerical Order were in ſmall Credit.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Schiſm</hi> of the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> was raiſed, one of the <hi>Popes</hi> having renounced, and the other two being deprived, and <hi>Martin</hi> the <hi>5th</hi> was Elected in Councel, <hi>Anno.</hi> 1417, all were in hopes, that by the Councel, and by the <hi>Pope</hi> all theſe diſorders in Beneficial matters would be Regulated, and indeed the Councel propoſed to the <hi>Pope</hi> the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles for Reforming the <hi>Reſervations,</hi> the <hi>first-Fruits,</hi> the <hi>Favours,</hi> the <hi>Expectancies,</hi> or <hi>Reverſions,</hi> the <hi>Commendings</hi> and the <hi>Collationings,</hi> but the new <hi>Pope</hi> and the Court deſiring to return home, and all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Councel being weary of the long Abſence from their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the treating of a matter ſo difficult which required ſo much time, was eaſily put off till the next Councel, which was intimated to be Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated in <hi>Pavia</hi> five years after, which moved the <hi>French</hi> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to expect a new Councel, wherefore 'twas ordered by a Decree of the Parliament, that <hi>no Obedience ſhould be yielded to the Pope, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Kings Edict were firſt Intimated and accepted by him,</hi> which E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict took away the <hi>Reſervations,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 195.</note> and the Exactions of Money, therefore <hi>Martin</hi> having ſent a <hi>Nuncio</hi> to give the King an Account of his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the King anſwered, he would have accepted it upon Condition that Elective <hi>Benefices</hi> were Conferr'd by Election, and the <hi>Reſervations</hi> and the <hi>Reverſions</hi> were taken away.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> was Content for that time, but in the year 1422, having gained the favour of ſome of the Univerſity, he endeavoured to cauſe the <hi>Reſervations</hi> to be received, however he could not obtain his intent, and they proceeded againſt his <hi>Promoters</hi> by Impriſonment. The <hi>Pope</hi> laid the <hi>Interdiction</hi> at <hi>Lions,</hi> and the <hi>Parliament</hi> Ordered it ſhould not be ſerved, and the Contention laſted until the year 1424, when the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60809:33"/>King Compounded with the <hi>Pope,</hi> that his Holyneſs ſhould have the <hi>Collations</hi> until that time for Lawful, and for the future all Commands ſhould be received; But the Atturney and the Advocate General with many of the Lords Oppoſed the Execution of it, and having Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the King the dammage of the Kingdom, they made this Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the King, to vaniſh into Smoak.</p>
            <p>In this Interval the Councel of <hi>Ravia</hi> was held, which after begun,<note place="margin">N. 196.</note> was transferr'd to <hi>Siena,</hi> and diſpatch'd with great Celerity, nothing of moment being Treated therein, but only hope given that in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel to be Celebrated ſeven years after at <hi>Baſel,</hi> all ſhould be Reformed. At the end of which ſeven years <hi>Martin</hi> dyed, and <hi>Eugenius</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> Succeeded in the Popedom, under whom in the Councel of <hi>Baſel Anno.</hi> 1431, the ſo much neceſſary and deſired Proviſion was made againſt diſorders in matters of <hi>Benefices;</hi> the <hi>Reſervations</hi> were Prohibited ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Vacanti in Curia,</hi> the <hi>Reverſions,</hi> the <hi>first-Fruits,</hi> and <hi>all other Exactions</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi> were alſo Prohibited.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> ſeeing his Power reſtrained, and his Wealth not able to Support, he Oppoſed the <hi>Councel,</hi> he endeavour'd to transfer it elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, to a place where he might manage the Prelates, which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to them, he could not Succeed, and many Contentions paſt between the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Councel,</hi> wherein Pious men Interpoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by daily Labour, found out a <hi>Medium,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 197.</note> but at laſt being fully reſolved to provide againſt Extorſions of Money, and the <hi>Pope</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Authority, and Conveniency, they came to an irreconcilable Breach. The <hi>Pope</hi> Annull'd the <hi>Councel,</hi> the <hi>Councel</hi> deprived the <hi>Pope,</hi> and choſe another, whereupon a Schiſm grew in the Church. That <hi>Councel</hi> was accepted in <hi>France</hi> and in <hi>Germany,</hi> and in the year 1438,<note place="margin">1438.</note> there was Publiſhed in <hi>France</hi> that Famous <hi>Pragmatica,</hi> whereby the <hi>Elections</hi> were <hi>restored</hi> to the <hi>Chapters,</hi> and the <hi>Collations</hi> to the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,</hi> and <hi>Reſervations</hi> were forbidden as in the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Baſel.</hi> That <hi>Councel</hi> was not received in <hi>Italy,</hi> where all adhered to the <hi>Pope,</hi> ſo that <hi>Reſervations</hi> took footing, and every <hi>Pope</hi> renew'd them without difficulty, and Introduced new Grievances beſides in the Collation of <hi>Benefices,</hi> none of them ever moderating himſelf, unleſs when a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod was found to work the ſame Effect by an eaſier way: <hi>Julius</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>10th</hi> introduced <hi>Mental Reſervations,</hi> which they ſo called, and by another name, <hi>Reſervations in the Breast,</hi> which were not made publick like the reſt, neither were they known,<note place="margin">N. 198.</note> unleſs when a <hi>Benefice</hi> became Vacant, if the Ordinary Conferr'd it, or if any one went to crave it, the <hi>Datary</hi> anſwered, that the <hi>Pope</hi> had reſerved it in his mind, a method or faſhion which laſted ſome years, but then 'twas left off, becauſe it became incommodious to the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> alſo. All other methods were carryed on to exceſs, for as touching <hi>Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Favorem</hi> introduced heretofore, and practized, there was added the Reſigning the Title only of the <hi>Benefice,</hi> reſerving to himſelf all the Fruits thereof, which in exiſtence was nothing elſe, but remaining Patron of the <hi>Benefice</hi> juſt as before it was renounced, he Conſtituting to himſelf a Succeſſor, who was in Name <hi>Titular,</hi> before the Death of the <hi>Renouncer,</hi> but in Fact he had no Right, and that the new <hi>Titular</hi> Perſon (who having a mind to gather the Fruits for the behoof of the Renouncer) might not make himſelf Maſter of any thing, there was added alſo, that not only all the Fruits were Reſerved to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncer,<note place="margin">N. 199.</note> but alſo that he might exact them by his own Authority.</p>
            <pb n="68" facs="tcp:60809:34"/>
            <p>There was nothing which might make the <hi>Reſignator</hi> different from the entire Patron, but that if in Caſe the <hi>Titular</hi> dyed before him, all the Fruits of the <hi>Benefice</hi> remained to him, but he could no more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate himſelf a Succeſſor, and the Title might be given by the Collator to whom he pleaſed that ſhould Succeed after the Renouncers Death.</p>
            <p>The Court wanted not for an Excellent Remedy for this likewiſe, which was the <hi>Regreſs.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Regreſs.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the Primitive times of the Church there was a Holy and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Cuſtom, that when a man was appointed to a Church, <hi>he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver left his Charge in all his Life,</hi> for to have a <hi>Benefice</hi> of greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come or of greater Honour; it ſeemed enough for every one to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the beſt of his Office; ſometimes for neceſſity, when there was not a fit Perſon for a great Charge, the Superior took one who was Occupyed in a Leſs,<note place="margin">N. 200.</note> and by Obedience transferr'd him to the Greater, a thing which afterwards was ſought after by ſome, either for greater Commodiouſneſs or for Profit, whereby the Tranſlation which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual, became moſt Cuſtomary, and the Sollicitation of every one was ſuch, to raiſe his Degree, that oftentimes having left that in Poſſeſſion, and impetrated for another, his Impetration proving vitious, he has been deprived of both, which being inconvenient, Cuſtom obtained, that if the Impetration of the ſecond place could not take Effect, the Perſon <hi>Beneficyed</hi> might return to the firſt without more ado, and this was called the <hi>Regreſs.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Regreſs.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner to this there was invented the granting a <hi>Faculty</hi> to the <hi>Reſignant,</hi> that when-ever the <hi>Reſignatory</hi> ſhould dye or Renounce the Title, he might without more ado return to the Reſigned <hi>Benefice,</hi> and by his own Authority take Poſſeſſion anew, and make it his own as if he had never renounced it; and if he ſhould not have taken to himſelf the firſt Poſſeſſion of the Renouncement (in which caſe the Regreſs cannot take place) he may by Acceſs,<note place="margin">N. 201.</note> and by Ingreſs take Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion likewiſe by his own Authority, without any other Miniſtry of the Judge, and this is called a <hi>Regreſs.</hi> Therefore the receiving and the admitting the Renouncements upon theſe Conditions, and therewith to give Title to the Reſignatory, hath never been permitted by the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to others, but hath reſerved it to himſelf only. This Method was Condemned by all the Writers, chiefly by the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and Prohibited by the Parliament, neither could it be cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any fair Pretext of Antiquity, wherefore there were ſome who made a Conſcience and were aſhamed to uſe it, for whoſe ſatisfaction there was found out another of an Antient Original, but according to Cuſtom fitted for the preſent Occaſions.<note place="margin">Coadjutors.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This was the <hi>Coadjutory,</hi> a moſt Antient and a moſt Commendable Cuſtom there was in the Churches, that when any Miniſter, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, or other became unable or leſs fit to perform his Charge through old Age, or by Infirmity of Mind or of Body, or for other Cauſe he took to himſelf,<note place="margin">N. 202.</note> or the Superior gave him an Aſſiſtant, who together with him might bear the Burden, but he had nothing to do with the Office or <hi>Benefice,</hi> but whilſt he lived, whoſe <hi>Coadjutor</hi> he was, who being Dead, a new <hi>Titular</hi> one was made.</p>
            <p>This Proviſion was alwayes Commended, and never was any Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition made againſt it.</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:60809:34"/>
            <p>Afterwards 'twas Conſidered, that if it were Ordered, that the <hi>Coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutor</hi> might Succeed, a greater Benefit would ariſe; Firſt he would be more diligent in managing a thing which was to be his own, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would love him, and would repute him more as their own, than another; upon which the <hi>Coadjutor</hi> was made with a Succeſſion to come, a thing which had Defenders and Oppoſers. 'Twas Oppoſed by ſaying, that every Succeſſion in Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Benefices</hi> is Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it offers Occaſion of procuring or deſiring another mans Death.</p>
            <p>'Twas defended with the Famous Example of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> who by <hi>Valerius</hi> his <hi>Predeceſſor</hi> was made <hi>Coadjutor</hi> with future Succeſſion,<note place="margin">N. 203.</note> which Example ſerves not very well, becauſe St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> himſelf blames it afterwards, and would not follow it, and was not aſhamed to ſay that it was done by him and by his Predeceſſor out of Ignorance. But in the times we ſpeak of, they not only gave <hi>Coadjutors</hi> with future Succeſſion, unto Prelates, and to others which have Adminiſtration, but alſo in ſingle <hi>Benefices,</hi> where is no need of being Aſſiſted, ſo that the <hi>Coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutor</hi> retains only the Name, there being nothing Real, but the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Succeſſion, which is a thing ſo abhorred by the <hi>Canons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas practized or uſed in theſe times, that whatſoever Beneficyary who would make himſelf a Succeſſor indifferently according to his dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent pleaſure, or make a <hi>Coadjutor</hi> with a future Succeſſion, or reſign in his favour reſerving to himſelf the Fruits, and with <hi>Regreſs,</hi> but yet this was <hi>Reſerved to the Pope only,</hi> and in no wiſe granted to other <hi>Collators.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Councel of <hi>Baſile</hi> was received in <hi>Germany</hi> by ſome, and by others not, and therefore <hi>Beneficyal</hi> Cauſes were differently underſtood.<note place="margin">N. 204.</note> To provide againſt the Diverſities and Diſſentions 'twas agreed in the year 1448 between <hi>Nicolas</hi> the <hi>5th,</hi> and <hi>Frederick</hi> the <hi>Emperor</hi> in this manner, that <hi>Benefices Vacant in Curia</hi> ſhould be reſerved to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and for the Remainder of the Elective <hi>Benefices,</hi> they ſhould proceed by Election; As for others, thoſe <hi>Vacant in ſix Months</hi> ſhould be the <hi>Popes,</hi> in the other ſix they ſhould be diſtributed by the <hi>Ordinary Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> adding alſo that if the <hi>Pope</hi> had not in the term of three Months Conferr'd thoſe which belonged to him, the <hi>Collation</hi> ſhould devolve to the <hi>Ordinaries.</hi> The Agreement was received throughout all <hi>Germany,</hi> and until the year 1518, ſome <hi>Dioceſſes</hi> obſerved the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Baſile,</hi> which annull'd all <hi>Reſervations.</hi> But in <hi>Progreſs</hi> of time, thoſe alſo who received the Agreement at the beginning, forbore to obſerve it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and excuſed themſelves, ſaying, that the Agreement was not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally received, and hath loſt its force through diſuſe, ſo that (we treat not of thoſe Cities where the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Chapters</hi> are departed from the <hi>Roman Church</hi>) but alſo in the Churches which remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Obedience, little or nothing was obſerved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>7th,</hi> in the year 1534 made a ſevere <hi>Bull,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 205.</note> but it took but little Effect. In the year 1576 <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>8th</hi> made another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out better Succeſs. In the <hi>Diet</hi> at <hi>Ratisbone Anno.</hi> 1594,<note place="margin">1576.</note> 
               <hi>Cardinal Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drutius</hi> a <hi>Legate</hi> of <hi>Pope Clement</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> made a great Querimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this in the name of the <hi>Pope,</hi> no Fruit appeared. At preſent there remains the ſame variety and Confuſion; The <hi>Romon Court</hi> hath but two Remedies only, one by the means of the <hi>Confeſſions</hi> of <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> which work by terms of Conſcience, that <hi>Beneficyaries</hi> provided by <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> are Content to take the <hi>Bulls</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſome do it;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60809:35"/>the other Remedy uſed by the <hi>Court</hi> but in Benefices of Importance and with Perſons partly depending on them, is, that <hi>an Election or a Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being made contrary to the Agreement, the Court annull's it,</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Confer's it on the ſame Perſon,<note place="margin">N. 206.</note> a Remedy much uſed hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon other occaſions alſo, not becauſe it helps at that very time, but becauſe keeping thoſe Writings, they make uſe of them in Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding times, to ſhew that they had Obedience; as ſo many other <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals</hi> which took no Effect, are nevertheleſs in the <hi>Decretal Books</hi> for the ſame deſign.</p>
            <p>In <hi>France</hi> the <hi>Pragmatica</hi> was rigidly conteſted by <hi>Pius</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> which the <hi>French Clergy</hi> and the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> oppoſed Conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wherefore the <hi>Pope</hi> turned himſelf unto <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>11th,</hi> ſhewing him how it was unſeemly to him, that in his Kingdom they ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the <hi>Decrees</hi> of the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Baſel,</hi> againſt which he being the Royal firſt born, departed from the Father out of diſtaſt, went with Arms, received Moneys from <hi>Pope Eugenius</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> to diſturb the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel;</hi> for which Reaſons <hi>King Lewis Anno.</hi> 1461,<note place="margin">Pragmatick Sanction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked.</note> Revoked the <hi>Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matica</hi> and made it to ceaſe, but there following a <hi>Reclamation</hi> of the <hi>

Innocent</hi> the <hi>8th, Alexander</hi> the <hi>6th</hi> and <hi>Julius</hi> the <hi>2d</hi> uſed all means to Aboliſh it, but could never Obtain it; Finally <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>10th</hi> made an Agreement with <hi>King Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> the Firſt,<note place="margin">And taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way again.</note> by which the <hi>Pragmatica</hi> was taken away, and 'twas Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that the Power of <hi>Chooſing Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Abbots</hi> ſhould be quite taken away from the <hi>Chapters</hi> of <hi>Cathedral Churches,</hi> and from the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventuals,</hi> but <hi>Biſhopricks</hi> and <hi>Abbeys</hi> becoming Vacant, the <hi>King</hi> might name a fit Perſon, on whom the <hi>Pope</hi> was to Confer the Benefice.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> could not give Reverſions, nor make gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or ſpecial Reſervations, but that <hi>Benefices</hi> becoming Vacant in four Months of the year, ſhould be Conferr'd by the <hi>Ordinaries</hi> on the <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duates</hi> of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 208.</note> and the Vacants in the other eight Months, might be freely <hi>Conferr'd</hi> by the ſaid <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> only that every <hi>Pope</hi> in his life time may Charge any <hi>Collator</hi> of <hi>Benefices</hi> to Confer one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diſpoſal of his Holyneſs, in caſe there are to be Conferr'd between <hi>Ten,</hi> and <hi>Fifty,</hi> and if there be above <hi>Fifty</hi> or more he may Confer two; and although there were many Difficulties in <hi>Accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Agreement,</hi> and the Univerſity appealed to the next Lawful Councel, nevertheleſs the <hi>Authority</hi> and the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tility</hi> of <hi>King Francis</hi> overcame, and the Agreement was Proclaimed in <hi>France,</hi> and put in Execution. In ſuch manner that after ſo many <hi>Popes</hi> from the year 1076 unto 1150, ſtrove by the Excommunicating an infinite number of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and by the Death of Innumerable more to take from Princes the <hi>Conferring</hi> of <hi>Biſhopricks,</hi> and giving the Election to the <hi>Chapters;</hi> contrary-wiſe <hi>Pius</hi> the 2d with five of his Succeſſors have ſtriven to take the Election from the Chapters of <hi>France,</hi> and give it to the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>10th</hi> did obtain it at laſt;<note place="margin">N. 209.</note> Thus the Alteration of Intereſts bear along with it the Change and Contrariety of Doctrine.</p>
            <pb n="71" facs="tcp:60809:35"/>
            <p>Some <hi>Speculative men</hi> have accounted the Reaſon of this to be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Example that the Biſhop and the Clergy might Confer, may keep alive the Practice, and the moſt general Doctrine of the Church, Contrary to the Modern; others becauſe it is ſtill more eaſie to take it out of the hands of a <hi>King,</hi> who may be of a <hi>weak Spirit,</hi> or may ſtand in <hi>need</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> than from the Biſhops and Clergy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>King Francis</hi> made many Laws beſides to regulate the Poſſeſſory of <hi>Benefices,</hi> and the Agreement was obſerved by him, but the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was interrupted for ſome years by his Son <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> when he was in War with <hi>Pope Julius</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> becauſe of <hi>Parma;</hi> wherefore in the year 1550, the King Prohibited that any Proviſion of the <hi>Popes Benefices</hi> ſhould be received, and Commanded that all ſhould be conferr'd by the Ordinaries; but Peace being made, all was Compoſed, and the Obſervance of the Agreement returned.</p>
            <p>But in the year 1560, the <hi>States</hi> were held at <hi>Orleans</hi> in <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>9th's Minority,</hi> where the Collations of <hi>Benefices</hi> were regulated,<note place="margin">N. 210.</note> and many things aboliſhed which were Contained in the Agreement. Great Confuſions and Wars happened in the Kingdom, and the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Ferrara</hi> was ſent <hi>Legate</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> who Obtained that the <hi>Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of <hi>Orleans</hi> ſhould be ſuperſeded, with a Promiſe that the <hi>Pope</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a ſhort time ſhould provide againſt the Abuſes, for which the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances were made, of which nothing was done afterwards, ſo that now the <hi>Concordate</hi> remains; Thus went the Affairs in <hi>Germany</hi> and in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>State of Italy</hi> which we have lately deſcribed, was greatly altered by the Celebration of the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> which made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Decrees on this Matter, to provide againſt the Abuſes aboveſaid then reigning, and although from its beginning, which was in the year 1547, it began to attend theſe Corrections, and made many Decrees which were not put in Execution until after the end of it, which was <hi>Anno.</hi> 1563, wherefore it may be ſaid, that all the Proviſions are to be referr'd unto this time.<note place="margin">N. 211.</note> 'Twas the Intent of this Councel to remedy three things; Firſt the <hi>Plurality</hi> of <hi>Benefices;</hi> Secondly,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pluralities</hi> 2 Hereditary Succeſſion. 3 Abſence.</note> 
               <hi>Hereditary Succeſſion;</hi> Thirdly, the <hi>Abſence</hi> of <hi>Beneficiated</hi> men, and to Prohibit all kind of <hi>Plurality,</hi> 'twas Ordained that one, although he were a <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,</hi> could not have more than <hi>one Benefice,</hi> but if that were ſo ſmall that it might not ſerve or be ſufficient for the Expences of the <hi>Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyed,</hi> he might have one more, which was therefore to be <hi>without Cure of Souls:</hi> It Prohibited the <hi>Commendum's</hi> of <hi>Benefices, Curati ad Vitam,</hi> which was a Pretence to make a man Obtain two; it Ordained alſo that <hi>Monaſteries</hi> for the future ſhould not be <hi>Commended,</hi> and thoſe that were ſo till then, when they became Vacant ſhould be reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Title; It Prohibited alſo the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions ad Vitam</hi> which was another pretext of giving divers <hi>Benefices</hi> under the name of one; It Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted totally the <hi>Regreſſes,</hi> and the <hi>Acceſſes</hi> to take away <hi>Succeſſion;</hi> It Prohibited alſo the <hi>Coadjutorſhips</hi> with <hi>future Succeſſion,</hi> abſolutely, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting in <hi>Cathedrals,</hi> and <hi>Monasteries,</hi> wherein was Admoniſhed,<note place="margin">N. 212.</note> that they ſhould not be granted by the <hi>Pope</hi> but for juſt Cauſes, but the Prohibition is without Effect.</p>
            <p>In the 14 laſt moneths <hi>Reſidency</hi> was treated with ſome Contention;<note place="margin">Reſidency.</note> becauſe there was ſprung up a Queſtion among the Doctors a little before, whether the <hi>Reſidency</hi> of Biſhops and of other Curates in their Churches were <hi>de Jure Divino,</hi> or Canonick, for which cauſe the Councel was
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60809:36"/>divided in ſuch a manner, that in <hi>April Anno</hi> 1562. a Scrutiny being made of the number of both Parties, there 67 found whoſe Opinion 'twas <hi>de Jure Divino,</hi> 33, who opinion'd it to be <hi>de Jure Poſitivo,</hi> and 30, who were of Opinion that this Point ought not to be decided without firſt treating with the <hi>Pope.</hi> Of the firſt number were the Northern men and other caſt-off Biſhops, on the Second and the third the Dependents on the Court. If Reſidency ſhould have been made <hi>de Jure Divino,</hi> it would follow that the <hi>Pope</hi> could not have been able to diſpence it, but that the Authority of the Biſhop alſo would have been <hi>de Jure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino,</hi> and no man was able to reſtrain it,<note place="margin">N. 213.</note> theſe were things which <hi>Squinted</hi> at the Depreſſion of the Courts Greatneſs, wherefore the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion was Maintained by both Parties with much boldneſs; The Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs came to Practices, ſo that after fourteen months Reſidency was Commanded, yet not declared <hi>quo Jure</hi> the Curate ſhould be Obliged, only Penalties were enjoyned upon <hi>non-Reſidents,</hi> as to other things, they were left in their firſt Eſtate or Condition, but thoſe who were at the Councel, and have left any works eſpecially of Divinity, have Maintained Reſidency to be <hi>de Jure Divino,</hi> proceeding ſo far, that to affirm the Contrary, they eſteemed it a deluding of the Holy Scripture, and natural Reaſon it ſelf, and all Antiquity, but not to provoke the Court againſt its ſelf, they have found out Exceptions by which the <hi>Pope</hi> may make us Diſpenſations.</p>
            <p>The Councel ſpake not of Reſervations chiefly,<note place="margin">Reſervations.</note> (which were encreaſed above meaſure) becauſe they Concerned the <hi>Popes</hi> own Perſon,<note place="margin">N. 214.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſtill remained; yea they were Encreaſed afterwards. It ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that in taking away the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions,</hi> and the <hi>Commendums ad Vitam,</hi> the <hi>Regreſſes</hi> and the <hi>Coadjutorſhips</hi> were in a great ſhare proceeded if not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, yet the greateſt part; however a ſpeedy Remedy was found out which not only did the ſame, but much more, yea greater than the four above named,<note place="margin">Penſion.</note> and that was the <hi>Penſion.</hi> 'Tis an obſervation of Godly men, that in thoſe times the <hi>Court</hi> would never be induced that a gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Abuſe ſhould be Aboliſhed or Corrected, until it had prepared a greater and a more profitable one, but in this 'tis very certain to be ſo; and therefore 'tis to be obſerved, that it is not a thing of theſe our times only, the laying a Penſion upon Benefices, only the manner is new, and the frequency is peculiar to our times.</p>
            <p>When the Church Goods were in Common, the name was unheard of, after the Rule or Canon practiz'd by all was made, that <hi>Benefices</hi> ſhould be Conferr'd intirely and without Diminution.<note place="margin">N. 215.</note>
            </p>
            <p>After that the Clergy among themſelves gave a beginning of going to Law with them, when the Cauſe was doubtful, one ſide yielding up his Rights, if a part of the Incomes was granted him with the name of a <hi>Penſion:</hi> Likewiſe if two Beneficyaries for ſome good Reſpect with Authority of the Superior ſhould interchange Benefices, if the Incomes were not equal, they patch'd up that with a Penſion, which the Richeſt left.</p>
            <p>Afterwards alſo when any one Reſigned with Licence of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,<note place="margin">Penſions.</note> a <hi>Penſion</hi> was left him, on which he might live. There are <hi>Popes Decretals</hi> of theſe three ſorts of Penſions, which were about the year 1200. And theſe ſorts the <hi>French</hi> admit of alſo by Juriſdictions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to admit of the others, which are thoſe that are given only to afford a livelyhood to one, to another becauſe he is well-deſerving from the Apoſtolick See, to another becauſe he is Learned, or becauſe he is
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60809:36"/>of a gentile Behaviour, or becauſe he hath ſerved the Church or the Prelate, alſo becauſe he hath the <hi>Popes</hi> favour only;<note place="margin">N. 216.</note> Alſo to a Youth, becauſe his <hi>Genius preſages a good event or Succeſs;</hi> All theſe are juſt Cauſes ſay the Canoniſts, why Penſions may be given, and they have no Regard to add, that without any Cauſe the <hi>Pope</hi> may give a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon any Benefice, to any Perſon he ſhall think fit, and he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives likewiſe without any Cauſe, but out of the <hi>Popes</hi> good Will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with a ſafe Conſcience. Now therefore inſtead that two Cured Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices were held, one in <hi>Title,</hi> the other in <hi>Commendum,</hi> were <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited ad Vitam,</hi> and the Party Beneficyed was forced to allow a ſtipend to him that ſerved in one of them, at preſent 'tis given to him in Title, and to himſelf for a Penſion the ſame which he takes, and it turns to the ſame, yea to his greater Advantage, becauſe he was Subject to give Account of the Errors which his Subſtitute had Committed, and there was ſome neceſſity for his taking care of it, but thus nothing lyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and the Profit is the ſame.</p>
            <p>In the like manner he that made a <hi>Coadjutor,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 217.</note> or renounced with a <hi>Regreſs,</hi> ought to take ſome Care of the Benefice of which he had a ſhare, and the which might become all his own, but renouncing, with reſerving a Penſion to himſelf, he remains free from all Care and thoughts, and if the Reſignatory dyes or yields up, it concerns him not, he hath his Penſion free, and without Moleſtation.</p>
            <p>Moreover 'tis more Profitable to have a <hi>Penſion,</hi> than a <hi>Benefice;</hi> firſt many <hi>Benefices</hi> require Holy Orders, and the Age of being able to receive them, as for the <hi>Penſion,</hi> the firſt ſhaving is ſufficient, and ſometimes the Age of ſeven years. Beſides <hi>Penſions</hi> are given to Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men alſo, as Commonly to the <hi>Knights of St. Peter,</hi> Inſtituted by <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>10th,</hi> and to thoſe of <hi>St. Paul</hi> Inſtituted by <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> and to the <hi>Pious</hi> Knights, Inſtituted by <hi>Pius</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> and to thoſe of <hi>Loreto,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by <hi>Sixtus</hi> the <hi>5th,</hi> which may have, ſome 150, ſome 200 Crowns Penſion, and to whomſoever the <hi>Pope</hi> pleaſeth; Again of <hi>Benefices,</hi> in the times when he that held more than one, there was alwayes ſome fault found with him, or they had a ſaying to him, and a Diſpenſation was neceſſary, which cauſed ſome Expences, notwithſtanding this, the Doctors put it in doubt, whether a man Secured himſelf in Conſcience,<note place="margin">N. 218.</note> 
               <hi>or no. Penſions</hi> may be had to any number without Scruple, and there is no <hi>Penſion Incompatible.</hi> A <hi>Penſion</hi> may be given with Authority, to transfer it to another according to ones own Will and Pleaſure, a thing which cannot be in <hi>Benefices</hi> without paſſing through the Bounds, and through the Ceremonies of Renouncing, and Renouncings were invalid, unleſs the <hi>Reſignatory ſurvived twenty dayes,</hi> but the <hi>Penſion</hi> might be transferr'd alſo at the Point of Death.</p>
            <p>That which chiefly Imports is, that the <hi>Penſion</hi> may be <hi>Extinguiſhed,</hi> which in <hi>Italian</hi> ſignifies to make a Sum of Money of it, for every Contract made about a <hi>Benefice,</hi> is accounted as <hi>Simony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>extinguiſh a Penſion,</hi> ſignifies nothing elſe, but to receive a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Money, to free the <hi>Beneficyary</hi> from paying the <hi>Penſion,</hi> which quantity is Taxed by Agreement, according to the greater or to the leſſer Age of the <hi>Penſionary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Formerly before our Age,<note place="margin">N. 219.</note> there was no way to make ready Money of a <hi>Benefice,</hi> that would have been with an Infinite Offence before God, and before men; now 'tis done Lawfully. I have a <hi>Benefice</hi> of 200 Crowns. I renounce it unto <hi>Antony,</hi> reſerving to my ſelf a <hi>Penſion</hi> of

            <p>To give Commendations to whom they are due, the Diligence uſed by the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is not to be omitted, not to ſuffer that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and other Collators of Benefices ſhould give place to any Abuſe, they never permitted them the Power to <hi>unite Benefices ad Vitam,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Commendings <hi>ad Vitam,</hi>

            <p>'Tis Conſtantly Affirmed by all <hi>Canonists</hi> and Caſuiſts, that <hi>every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract in matter of Benefice is Simoniacal,</hi> if it be made without the <hi>Popes</hi> Participation, but with his <hi>Intervention</hi> every thing is <hi>Legitimate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 224.</note> hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Conſtant this general Propoſition, which is, that the <hi>Pope in Beneficial matters cannot Commit Simony,</hi> which gives no very good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification to the World, yet the moſt Modeſt <hi>Canonists</hi> do limit it, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing ſome kind of <hi>Simony</hi> to be forbidden by Divine Law, and another by the Law of man, adding that the <hi>Pope</hi> only is exempt from Committing <hi>Simony</hi> forbidden by Humane Law: But notwithſtanding this, they ſtumble upon the ſame Difficulties, becauſe that which is not evil by its own Nature, nor forbidden by God, deſerves not this name, and it is ſuperfluous to make a Humane Law not to obſerve it, and he that ſhall look into it, and not make himſelf a Pretext with Words, ſhall ſee, that all is forbidden by God, and certainly it cannot be ſaid, that in this Part of holding the other Biſhops in Office, the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould have failed, and it hath been a very great Grace of God ſhewn to the <hi>Popes,</hi> that they have been able to keep the Remainder of the Church ſincere from <hi>Simony,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 225.</note> and yet they have not been able to extend this good to themſelves, nor to their Court; And if one day, as there is hopes, that it may come into ſome good <hi>Popes</hi> mind to Reform the Court, it would be a moſt eaſie thing to do it, only by <hi>receiving thoſe Laws for himſelf, which are given to other Biſhops;</hi> and we might ſhortly expect ſuch a Profitable Reformation, if Flattery kept it not off at a diſtance, by Propoſing to the <hi>Popes,</hi> that they being in Poſſeſſion at leaſtwiſe in <hi>Italy</hi> and in a few other places, were not Subject to any Rule, it being not good to Deprive themſelves, and do that Prejudice to the Apoſtolick See, quite Contrary to the Doctrine Profeſſed by the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Holy <hi>Popes,</hi> and Doctors. But by the things aboveſaid, it is very clear, whether the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> may have full Authority over Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Eſtates and Benefices, ſo as not to be ſubject to any Rule in the managing of them; wherefore proceeding by Reaſon,<note place="margin">N. 226.</note> if the Church of each place be Miſtreſs of the Eſtates which ſhe Poſſeſſeth, becauſe the Dominion hath been transferr'd to her, by him who was the firſt Maſter of them, with the leave of the Prince, who by Law hath grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her Purchaſing; it remains that the Eſtates ought to be under the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60809:38"/>Government, and Adminiſtration of thoſe who are appointed for that Charge, Firſt according to the Diſpoſition of the Law, and then accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Conditions which the Donor Preſcribes, and the Teſtator formerly Patron of it, and finally, according as the Church hath grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who is made Miſtreſs of it, yet not going contrary to the Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe, from whom it hath Cauſe. And this is ſo Evident and Clear, that it cannot be put in Doubt, unleſs by one who hath not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, or elſe, who in treating and ſpeaking, follows not that which he is inwardly ſenſible of.</p>
            <p>The Clerks or Clergy-men are become Adminiſtrators of theſe Goods by Laws which have granted unto Chriſtian Colledges, the Power of acquiring Eſtates,<note place="margin">N. 227.</note> both by Wills and Donations of thoſe who have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed their Goods, and by the Authority which the Church hath given unto the ſaid Clergy in the <hi>Canons;</hi> therefore they are Obliged to Govern and to Diſpence theſe Eſtates according to the Laws, Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Donations, and Teſtamentary Diſpoſitions, and according to the <hi>Canons:</hi> and that which might be done Contrary to it, cannot be called otherwiſe than Injuſtice, Injury, and Uſurpation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Canonists</hi> ſay, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath moſt full Power over the Goods and Benefices Eccleſiaſtical, ſo that he may conjoyn them, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them, erect new ones, give them <hi>ad nutum,</hi> Confer them before they become Vacant, lay upon them Servitudes, Burdens, and <hi>Penſions,</hi> and generally that in Beneficial matters, the <hi>Popes</hi> Will is in the ſtead of Reaſon or Right.</p>
            <p>This Sufficeth not, but they add, that the <hi>Pope</hi> may alter or tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form into other Works, the Legacies <hi>ad Pias Cauſas,</hi> and may alter the Diſpoſition of Teſtators, applying that to another, which they ſhall have appointed for a Pious Work, and it cannot be denyed that this is the Practice which hath changed all the Government and all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Inſtitutions,<note place="margin">N. 228.</note> but it remains ſtill in Doubt, who does amiſs and errs, the Antient or the Modern, if ſo much as a Doubt may happen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Martin Navarr</hi> with ſome of the more Moderate <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> limits this Propoſition, that the <hi>Pope</hi> may alter the laſt Wills, only reſtraining when there is a Lawful cauſe of doing it, which otherwiſe would be to deprive a man of his own, and of the Power granted him by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and by the Divine Law, coming down alſo to this Particular, that the <hi>Pope</hi> cannot without Cauſe give that to one Church, which is left unto another, therefore how much leſs unto Perſons not called. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varrus</hi> ſaith alſo, that the ſaying of the Gloſs approved by the <hi>Canonists:</hi> That is, in <hi>Beneficyal</hi> Matters, the <hi>Popes Will</hi> is <hi>instead and takes the Place</hi> of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> is to be underſtood only in things which are <hi>de Jure Poſitivo,</hi> but not in that which cannot be done without diſagreeing with Natural and Divine Law: And thoſe who give no unlimited Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unto the <hi>Pope,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 229.</note> would alſo exclude the <hi>Canons</hi> of the Univerſal Church, not to fall into the Abſurdity, that in a Matter of ſuch Importance the Univerſal Church ſhould have erred, and done amiſs, and that the Court ſhould do uprightly. The ſaid <hi>Navarrus</hi> adds further, that it being ſaid in the <hi>Clementines,</hi> that the <hi>Free Diſpoſal</hi> of <hi>Benefices</hi> belongs to the <hi>Pope;</hi> The word Free is or ought to be underſtood, <hi>without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, Leave,</hi> or <hi>Conſent,</hi> and notwithſtanding the Contradiction of any man ſoever, but yet without Prejudice of the Third; if we ſhould admit of this Expoſition, as it ſeems Convenient to be admitted, there would be ſeen a great Oppoſition to Reſervations, becauſe they are
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60809:38"/>Prejudicial to the Biſhops in the giving of Benefices unto Strangers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is with Prejudice to thoſe of the Country, in whoſe Favour the Wills are made, and it would not be very favourable to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, to have Power or to be able to alter the laſt Will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being Prejudicial to the Memory of the Deceaſed. I know well that others anſwer to this, that all is true,<note place="margin">N. 230.</note> when there is no Legitimate Cauſe; but the Point is, who ſhall be Judge of the Lawfulneſs of the Cauſe, for if it belongs to himſelf, whoſe Authority is to be reſtrained; 'tis as good to give him the Abſolute Authority, as that which is limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Lawful Cauſe, unleſs the Law be above it. <hi>Navarrus</hi> adds very Notable things, ſaying, that in our Age, the Opinion of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſconſults which expatiate ſo much the <hi>Papal</hi> Power in <hi>Beneficyal</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is in much Credit to pleaſe thoſe who are Ambitious of many Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, which they accept as fitted for their Ambition and Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who heard a Divine ſay Publickly, and a Famous <hi>Canoniſt,</hi> that they would willingly accept of all the <hi>Benefices</hi> of the Kingdom, if the <hi>Pope</hi> would Beſtow them upon them, but on the Contrary <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> told them, that the Juriſconſults are wont to attribute more Power than Convenient to the <hi>Pope,</hi> whereto he anſwered, that there are ſome alſo which do not Extol, but that it behooveth to walk in the middle way, having Reſpect unto Divine and Humane Laws together,<note place="margin">N. 231.</note> not doing like the Modern Juriſconſults, who Magnifie Humane Laws ſo much, that they anſwer againſt the Divine.</p>
            <p>However I intend not to Contradict the Opinion which gives ſo much Power for the Reverence due to the Pope of whom is treated, although it Comprehends not how it agrees with Divinity and with Reaſon, I ſhall only propoſe ſome Difficulties, which are wont to be Promoted by Writers on ſuch an Opinion, which when they ſhall have reſolved, truth in this matter will be moſt clear.</p>
            <p>And firſt, If the <hi>Pope</hi> hath ſuch an Ample Authority, who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it him? <hi>Not Christ;</hi> becauſe the Authority given by him is only is Spiritual things for <hi>looſing,</hi> and for <hi>binding,</hi> that is, for remitting and for retaining of Sins. And then the Eccleſiaſtical Eſtates are Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed <hi>de Jure Hamano,</hi> and not <hi>Divino,</hi> and for ſuch it hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved above, and therefore he hath not receive this Power from God, much leſs from the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> from Teſtamentary Diſpoſitions,<note place="margin">N. 232.</note> nor from the <hi>Canons</hi> of the Churches; becauſe all theſe have given the Adminiſtration to the Clergy-men of each Church, over the Eſtates and Benefices thereof, and preſcribedly alſo with limited Conditions, that they may not be altered, therefore he hath it not from theſe. There are no other Patrons in being, nor none can have Authority, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs granted by theſe, therefore it remains to be Conſidered from whence, and by what other way it hath been given him.</p>
            <p>To this Doubt a ſecond may be added; if the <hi>Pope</hi> hath this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, what is the Cauſe that his Predeceſſors for a <hi>Thouſand years and more</hi> have never Exercized any, nor any Antient <hi>Doctor,</hi> nor <hi>Councel,</hi> nor <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> nor <hi>Father,</hi> nor <hi>Canon,</hi> hath ſo much as made mention of it? It cannot be Attributed that there is a neceſſity for that now which was not in thoſe times, becauſe that in the Ages that paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the years 800 and 1100, for 300 years the Diſorders were ſo great throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi> that in Compariſon of thoſe,<note place="margin">N. 233.</note> theſe at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent are Tollerable, and indeed no <hi>Pope</hi> did ſo much as intrude himſelf into the Eſtates of other Churches, which had great need of being Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.</p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:60809:39"/>
            <p>And after the <hi>Popes</hi> had begun to interpoſe themſelves in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, until the time of <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> no man ever pretended to ſuch an Ample and Abſolute Power, but the ſaid <hi>Clement</hi> hath not direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publiſhed ſuch a Power, but dealing otherwiſe, and almoſt Inciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, a way which is not wont to make an entire Proof, becauſe the things incidentally ſpoken in one way, being directly Conſidered and Examined, are oftentimes expreſſed after another way.</p>
            <p>Neither can it be ſaid, that this Authority ſerves for or tends to good, becauſe it appears thereby, that almoſt all the Abuſes have been Introduced. From hence proceeded the <hi>Commendums,</hi> the <hi>Penſions,</hi> the <hi>Regreſſes,</hi> the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions,</hi> the <hi>Reſignations,</hi> the <hi>Expectancies,</hi> the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations,</hi> the <hi>Yearly Payments,</hi> and the <hi>Quindenniums,</hi> and other kinds which no man defends, unleſs by excuſing them with the general Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the times.</p>
            <p>There remains yet a third Doubt,<note place="margin">N. 234.</note> no leſs Conſiderable in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is, that ſince the <hi>Popes</hi> have begun to make uſe of this ſo abſolute Authority, the <hi>Christian Kingdoms have alwayes Complained of it,</hi> and have made ſome Oppoſition againſt them, as is above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in this Hiſtory, ſo that the <hi>Popes</hi> have been neceſſitated to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate themſelves. And the Moderation was not in their Condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to forbear the exerciſe of their pretended Authority, but by way of Tranſaction practized in <hi>dark Reaſons,</hi> making agreement with King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and by Form of Contract, reſolving unto what Terms or Bounds their Power was to extend, a thing which might not have been done in Prejudice to their Succeſſors, if that Authority had been thus free in the Popedome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pope Leo</hi> the <hi>10th,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pragmatica Sanctio Concorda.</note> to take away the <hi>Pragmatica,</hi> makes the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordat,</hi> and ſo he himſelf calls it in his <hi>Bull:</hi> He that hath a moſt Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Authority makes not a <hi>Concord,</hi> but Treats with his Subjects like a Superior, and by way of Conceſſion; I offer no Violence to the word but in all the thing it ſelf,<note place="margin">N. 235.</note> 
               <hi>Leo</hi> not only calls it a <hi>Concordia,</hi> but ſayes alſo; <hi>Illam veri contractus, &amp; Obligationis inter nos, &amp; Sedem Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licam praedictam ex una, &amp; Praefatum Regem ex altera Partibus Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me initi.</hi> Some man may require that it be declared. The <hi>Popedome</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> having a Difference with the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> pretending to have an abſolute Authority over Benefices, to reſerve them to himſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Kingdom pretending, that the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity belongs to their Prelates, they forme two Parties at Law, and to put an end to the Controverſie, they make a <hi>Lawful Contract of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> whereby they declare what ought to be the Authority of each, how can any man ſay, that the <hi>Popes</hi> Pretenſion was Legitimate and Clear? I cannot ſay that I am able to anſwer any of theſe Difficulties, if there be any Anſwer, I Refer it to the Judgment of the Wiſe; well may I ſay, that Obſerving that which for above a <hi>Thouſand years hath been Obſerved,</hi> that Eccleſiaſtical Livings have been Adminiſtred in each Dioceſs,<note place="margin">N. 236.</note> their own, by their own Miniſters, all Difficulty is avoided, and if Examples ought to Inſtruct, they will be better and more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſpenſed than now they are.</p>
            <p>In the three firſt Queſtions hath been Treated of the Stocks or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of the Clergy, the <hi>4th</hi> now remains, wherein follows the Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Fruits, or Rents, or Incomes thereof. The Holy Fathers who have Written before the Diviſion of the Eſtates into four Parts, have all ſaid Unanimouſly that the <hi>Estates of the Clergy-men are the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60809:39"/>Poors,</hi> and that the Eccleſiaſtical Miniſter hath no other Power over them, but to Govern them, and to diſpenſe them according to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the Poor, declaring thoſe Miniſters to be not only <hi>Thieves,</hi> but alſo <hi>Sacrilegious,</hi> who made any other uſe of them beſides their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
            <p>All Clergy-men did not Manage the Eſtates, though indeed all were diſpenſed by them, as likewiſe the livelyhood was Adminiſtred to Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, to the Poor, and to other Miſerable Perſons; but according to the Example of the Inſtitution of the Holy Apoſtles, only the <hi>Deacons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 237.</note> 
               <hi>Sub-Deacons,</hi> and other <hi>Stewards</hi> were appointed thereunto, and gave an Account to the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and in ſome places to the <hi>Presbyter</hi> or <hi>Priest.</hi> The Diviſion being made, and the <hi>Benefices</hi> Inſtituted; although it would ſeem that the Biſhop, the Prieſts, and the other Clergy-men might do what they would, with the Beneficial Incomes, as with their own; yet the Writers ſpeak in this manner, ſaying, that a Clergy-man cannot make uſe of the Incomes of a Benefice, but as far as his Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate need requires, and the overplus he is obliged to ſpend in Pious uſes, and with much Reaſon, becauſe the Diviſion alters not the Subſtance of the thing, and an Eſtate if it comes to be Divided, both parts remain under the ſame Obligation. Amongſt others who write after the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding; St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> who was a little above 100 years after, and St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> who was almoſt 1000 years after, exclaim moſt heavily againſt thoſe who ſpend the Incomes of <hi>Benefices</hi> in ill uſes,<note place="margin">N. 238.</note> as againſt Perſons Uſurping the Common Stock, and Murtherers of the Poor which ought to be Maintained by them.</p>
            <p>Thus all the Doctors Wrote, until the year 1250, when they began to handle things more Subtilly, and holding it for Conſtant, as ſpoken by all the Antients, that it was a ſin to miſpend that which exceeds the Moderate neceſſity of the Clergy-man, 'twas enquired into, that if Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficed men not ſpending of that in due uſes, which exceeds above their need, whether they only ſin as a man ſins who miſ-ſpends his own, or whether alſo beſides the ſin they be Obliged unto Reſtitution, as ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumers of other mens Goods.</p>
            <p>If they be <hi>Patrons</hi> of the <hi>Fruits</hi> of the <hi>Benefices,</hi> or as the Laws ſay, <hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſuaries,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 239.</note> when they Diſpence not uprightly, they remain under an Obligation of reſtoring or making good as much more as they have Conſumed, much more thoſe who receive from them by Contract <hi>gratis,</hi> that is, thoſe to whom they give or leave by Teſtament, are Obliged to reſtore it, as having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it from one who was not the Maſter of it.</p>
            <p>Conſcience obliged me to ſet this Doubt on foot, which having been handled or treated on theſe 350 years, remains ſtill in Controverſie with equal number of Authorities on each ſide, and at laſt with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Oppoſitions and Apologies, 'twas in Controverſie between <hi>Martin Navarr a Canoniſt,</hi> and a Caſuiſt of great eſteem, and one named <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miento: Navarr</hi> holding that the Clergy-men are not Patrons, but Diſpenſators, ſo that they not only Commit ſin, but are Obliged unto Reſtitution. <hi>Cardinal Gaetan</hi> was of a middle Opinion, that it was a different thing between ſpeaking of Biſhops and Rich Abbots, and thoſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60809:40"/>who had only what was decent, or a little more, and that theſe having no more than their own ſhare,<note place="margin">N. 240.</note> are Maſters of it.</p>
            <p>But the Richeſt have alſo amongſt their Incomes, the part or ſhare of the Church and of the Poor, and therefore are Obliged to give Almes, and to do other Pious works for Righteouſneſs-ſake, that is, with Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of Reſtitution, both to them, and to him that Receives from them, deſcending to this Particular alſo, that thoſe are Obliged to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> who receive from the <hi>Pope, Eccleſiastical Estates,</hi> for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching, Exalting, or for the Ennobling themſelves, every Donation of Church Goods, which is not grounded upon Piety, or upon Neceſſity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Diſſipation and an Uſurpation.</p>
            <p>I believe that without a Subtil Diſputation, all the Doubts Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in this Matter may be Reſolved, and firſt, to ſpeak Separately of thoſe Incomes, which by Teſtaments, or other Original Inſtitutions are Dedicated and Ordained to ſome Pious work, to which I believe them ſo Obliged, that to appropriate them to ones ſelf, or to other World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſes, may be called freely Uſurpation of that which is another mans, and if any of the Beneficed Clergy-men forbears to Execute the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions which he hath in Charge,<note place="margin">N. 241.</note> applying thoſe Incomes to himſelf or to others, I do not believe he can under pretence of any Excuſe or <hi>Bull</hi> whatever, Excuſe himſelf from being in an equal Degree with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Executor of a Will, who ſhould apply to himſelf that, which is left by the Teſtator, unto another, and I make account that every man who will not deceive himſelf, will hold this for a Conſtant truth.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide Duty requires, that he who is ſerved, ſhould pay the work-man his Reward, who may do with it what he pleaſeth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be Doubted but the <hi>Singing man,</hi> the <hi>Organiſt,</hi> and others which ſerve in the Church, are Maſters of the Reward which they have therefore. It is not Inconvenient to ſay, that the Prieſts likewiſe, and other Clergy-men ought to have their Reward for the Services which they afford to the Church, of which Reward they are Maſters, and when a Benefice is Inſtituted with a particular Obligation to ſerve the Church in a determinate thing,<note place="margin">N. 242.</note> as are many <hi>Canonſhips, Manſionaries, Theologal Prebendaries,</hi> and ſuch other Benefices, it is not Inconvenient to ſay, that it is a Reward of that Work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Benefices</hi> are of ſuch <hi>Antiquity,</hi> that the <hi>Memory</hi> of their <hi>Inſtitution is lost,</hi> and therefore 'tis not known, whether they had any Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or no; But a Conſcientious man will be well Certified, when he ſhall Conſider the quantity of the Incomes, and the Service which he lends or yields to the Church, becauſe if theſe two were weighed in the Scale, he may believe that the Benefice is his Sallary, but if the Incomes exceed it by much, he can never fain himſelf to be Simple, who believes that ſo many Incomes were left him to do what he will with, and ſhould not know it to be neceſſary, that the Inſtitution ſhould bear with it ſome Obligation, it being not likely that ſo much ſhould be Aſſigned for him only.</p>
            <p>The Controverſie amongſt the Doctors which is difficult diſputing in General, is moſt eaſie and without difficulty practized in particulars; and the Conſcience of him who hath not Choaked it through his own Malice,<note place="margin">N. 243.</note> reſolves eaſily all Difficulties inwardly upon the Particular, which God hath not left unto any one in uncertainty, who is willing to walk according to his Commandments.</p>
            <pb n="81" facs="tcp:60809:40"/>
            <p>As to the <hi>New Acquiſitions,</hi> every prudent Perſon would have thought that they were at an end, or at leaſt that they could acquire or Purchaſe but ſlowly.</p>
            <p>There are now no more Perſons who bear a Devotion towards the <hi>Clergy-men, Monks,</hi> and <hi>Militia;</hi> The <hi>Mendicants</hi> who heretofore had the Power of Purchaſing, cannot hope to put it in Execution, whereas they have not been able to do it hitherto, and where they have Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed or Gained, if therewith they have not loſt the Devotion, they may yet hope for ſome Augmentation, but very ſlight: Thoſe others who have cauſed themſelves to be excluded from the Priviledge, which the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> hath granted to all of Purchaſing, as the <hi>Capucins,</hi> who preſerve the good Opinion by Reaſon of their Poverty, whereas immediately that they ſhould change their Inſtitution in the leaſt part,<note place="margin">N. 244.</note> they could not Purchaſe Eſtates, and would loſe their Alms. It ſeems therefore that no way is left to go any further. He that would Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute an Order with Power of Purchaſing, would have no Credit; He that would do it with meer Begging cannot hope to purchaſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, nor to have Credit if he ſhould change it. But notwithſtanding all this, there hath not wanted Proper wayes and Singular in our Age,<note place="margin">Inſtitution of Jeſuits.</note> and nothing Inferior to all the former, and that hath been the <hi>Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> which profeſſing a Mixture of Poverty and of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, with Poverty it gains Credit and Devotion, and hath the other hand Capable of Poſſeſſing, which receives that which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany gains. They have Inſtituted <hi>Profeſſing Houſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Profeſſing Houſes. Colledges.</note> with Prohibition of being able to Poſſeſs Eſtates, but the <hi>Colledges</hi> with Power of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing, and Poſſeſſing; they ſay, and that truly, <hi>that no ſingle Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the World is perfect, but that a Mixture is uſeful to every thing;</hi> That the Condition of <hi>Evangelical Poverty</hi> taken up by the <hi>Mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. 245.</note> hath this Defect, that it cannot Govern it ſelf therewith,<note place="margin">Evangelical Poverty.</note> but the foregoers, whoſe Number cannot be great, but they in the Colledges receive and Inſtruct Youth, and render them apt and ſit after the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Virtues, to live in the Evangelical Poverty, wherefore Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is indeed the Scope and their Eſſential end, but Accidentally they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Poſſeſſions.</p>
            <p>Beſides all this, 'tis better to ground ones Credulity upon that which is effectually ſeen, than upon that which is Preached in Word, they Write unto this preſen time to have one and <hi>twenty Profeſſing Houſes,</hi> and 293 <hi>Colledges,</hi> by the Proportion of which numbers, every one may Conclude that which is Eſſential, and that which is Accidental to them: Certain it is, that the Purchaſes made by them are exceeding great, and that they Proceed ſtill towards Augmentation.</p>
            <p>Even as all the Temporals which the Church Poſſeſſeth, comes from the Almes and Oblations of the Faithful, even ſo likewiſe the Building of the Antient Sanctuary in the Old Teſtament,<note place="margin">N. 246.</note> was made by Almes and Oblations, then when the People had Offered as much as ſuffized, yet the Oblations were Continued; The Over-ſeers of the <hi>Fabrick</hi> had recourſe unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying, the <hi>Peple carryes too much for the Work which the Lord hath Commanded,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> ſent forth a Proclamation, that no man ſhould make any more Offering to the Sanctuary, becauſe there had been Offered enough, and to ſpare.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſeen that God was not willing to have Superfluity in his Temple, and if in the Old Teſtament which was Worldly, he would not have all for his Miniſters, much leſs will he have it in the New: Where are theſe
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60809:41"/>Purchaſings to end? When it is to be ſaid amongſt us, the People hath Offered more of it than Suffizeth. When that the Miniſters of the Temple were the <hi>13th</hi> part of the People,<note place="margin">Tythes.</note> they received the <hi>Tenths,</hi> and 'twas not Lawful to exceed them; now that they are not the 100th, they have perhaps above a quarter.</p>
            <p>'Tis not Convenient, that the encreaſe of Eccleſiaſtical Eſtates ſhould be infinite,<note place="margin">N. 247.</note> and that all the World ſhould be reduced to be Tenants; Humane Laws amongſt Chriſtians have not limited the quantity of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates that any one Poſſeſſeth, for he that Purchaſeth to day, alienates to morrow: A Perpetual Condition of Perſons is very ſingular, which may alwayes Purchaſe, and never Alienate. In the Old Teſtament the <hi>Tythes</hi> were given to the <hi>Levites,</hi> becauſe they were <hi>Gods Inheritance,</hi> and therefore they were Forbidden to have any other ſhare, a thing which pertains to thoſe who are willing to make uſe of their Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, taking all to themſelves, and not only that which behooves their own Profit.</p>
            <p>It hath been abundantly ſpoken of, how the Eccleſiaſtical Eſtates have been gained, to whom the Care of them hath been Committed, and how Diſpenſed.</p>
            <p>Nothing hath been ſpoken of that which was done, when at the Death of the Beneficyary they found ſome of the Fruits not yet diſpoſed of, whether he diſpoſed of them by Will, or whether from the Inteſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man they paſſed unto other Perſons.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the Eſtate of each Church was in Common, and Governed by one Earl only,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Conto.</hi> 248.</note> 'tis a certain thing, that ſo much as was found in a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters hand was <hi>Incorporated with the Whole,</hi> and Governed in the ſame manner by the Succeſſor; But Benefices being erected, there were alſo <hi>Canons</hi> therewith made, that whatever part was found in the hand of the Beneficyary at his Death, ſhould be the Churches; and by the Church if it were Collegiate and had a Common Table, was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Colledge thereof; But if the Beneficyary was without Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league, by the Name of Church, was underſtood the Succeſſor, who was to Adminiſter that Remainder or Reſidue, after the ſame manner as the Deceaſed Predeceſſor was Obliged unto, ſo 'twas wont to be done until the year 1300. But becauſe the Beneficed Clergy-men had oftentimes other Goods of their own Patrimony, or elſe gain'd by his own Art and Induſtry, 'twas therewith ſaid, that of theſe he was the Abſolute Maſter, and might leave them by Will to whom he pleaſed; but of the Incomes of the Benefice he might not Diſpoſe, by reaſon of Death. From whence it follow'd, that Clergy-men Poſſeſſors of ſmall Benefices, not exceeding the expences, made a Will of all they had, and if by ſparing they had Advanced any thing to the Benefice,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Conto.</hi> 249.</note> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted it gain'd by Induſtry, and Diſpoſed of it in the ſame manner, which hath brought in a Cuſtom in many Chriſtian Kingdoms, that men of Inferior Benefices may make their Will, likewiſe of the Incomes of their Benefices, and not making a Will, the Heirs of the Inteſtate Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, as alſo in the Patrimonials. But that which was left by the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> remained to the Church according to the Antient <hi>Canons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, the Biſhops alſo through Cuſtom in many Chriſtian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms acquired the Power of making Wills, even of the Eccleſiaſtical Fruits, ſo that about the year 1300, in divers Countries there were three Different Cuſtoms found; 1. One where no Clergy-man might Diſpoſe of the Incomes of Benefices advanced them, <hi>2ly,</hi> The other
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60809:41"/>where the Incomes were upon the ſame Account, as things Patrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and their own, <hi>3ly,</hi> the third where Inferior Clergy-men bequeathed or diſpoſed, but what was left by the Biſhops went to the Church.<note place="margin">N. 250.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the times after 1300, when the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> had more need of Money than ordinary, they ſent their Miniſters into the Kingdoms where the Churches were wont to Inherit the Deceaſed Beneficed mans Eſtate, who before the Succeſſor was Choſen, applyed all to the <hi>Popes Chamber,</hi> which thing Succeeded eaſily, becauſe the Benefice becoming Vacant, there was none would Contradict it for his own Intereſt, and the Succeſſor being Created he acquieſced in a thing done without any more ado. They began to ſend ſuch Miniſters into all places where they could, and to lay claim to that which was left by the Deceaſed,<note place="margin">Booty or Spoyles. Collectors.</note> by the Name of Booty or Spoyles, and the <hi>Popes</hi> Officers ſent for them, were call'd Collectors. The <hi>Popes</hi> took theſe Spoyles where they could in this manner, ſilently without any Order or Law therein which might grant the ſame, but alwayes with ſome Murmuring, as well by the Heirs of the Deceaſed Prieſts, as alſo by other Perſons,<note place="margin">N. 251.</note> through the ſevere Extorſions which the Collectors and the Sub-Collectors made, who brought into the Account of Spoyles or Booty, the very Ornaments of the Churches, and gave alſo much Moleſtation to Heirs upon Goods gain'd by Induſtry, or received from the Patrimony, endeavouring to make them appear to be taken out of the <hi>Benefices,</hi> and doubtful of what quality they were, giving Sentence that they belong'd to the Chamber, vexing and tiring thoſe who Oppoſed them, with Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications and Cenſures.</p>
            <p>In <hi>France</hi> the uſe or cuſtom had Introduced that the <hi>Spoyles</hi> of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> and <hi>Abbeys</hi> ſhould be applyed to the <hi>Pope.</hi> And in the year 1385, <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>6th</hi> Prohibited it, Ordaining that Heirs ſhould have the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion as well in them, as in Patrimonial Goods; In many Countries the Cuſtom being Introduced, is Continued unto this Age, when by the Extorſion of the Collectors, the Complaints of many encreaſed ſo much, that ſome had the boldneſs to Oppoſe it openly, and to deny that the Spoyles of the Deceaſed Clergy-men belonged to the <hi>Popes</hi> Chamber. Wherefore in the year 1541, <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>3d</hi> was the firſt who made a <hi>Bull</hi> upon this matter,<note place="margin">N. 252.</note> where 'tis Related that ſome Curious Perſons to Uſurp to themſelves the Rights of the Apoſtolick Chamber, and to Defraud it, did call in queſtion, whether the Eſtates of Prelates, and of other Eccleſiaſtical Perſons called Spoyles belonged to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, there being no Apoſtolical Conſtitution which Appropriates it, though indeed by the ſending Collectors into divers places, it appears clearly to have been the mind of the Apoſtolick <hi>See,</hi> to reſerve them and apply or appropriate them to the Chamber, wherefore he Declares, Ordains, and Conſtitutes, that to the Pontifical Chamber ſhall belong the Spoyles of all the Clergy-men Deceaſed in whatſoever Kingdoms and Dominions, as well on this ſide, as beyond the <hi>Alpes,</hi> ſo likewiſe on this ſide, as well as beyond the Seas, although Collectors have never been appointed in them.</p>
            <p>So that the over-Diligent being willing to free ſome few Provinces from this Grievance or Burthen, have been Cauſe they have been Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all the World over: But yet it is not come to Execution,<note place="margin">N. 253.</note> except in the uſual places, but it hath thus happen'd in all things, as the World makes of Novelties, left off for ſometime without Execution, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with a good Opportunity, as if they had been Executed in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60809:42"/>due time, and by the Malice of ſome brought out of Uſe, by Cenſures and other Violences they are put in Execution.</p>
            <p>The Spoyles unto the year 1560, Comprehended nothing but that which was found at the Clergy-mans Death, proceeding from Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Incomes.</p>
            <p>In the year above ſaid <hi>Pius quartus</hi> made a <hi>Bull;</hi> that under the Name of <hi>Spoyles,</hi> which throughout the World, in all Dominions on this ſide and beyond the <hi>Alps</hi> and the Seas, belong to the <hi>Chamber,</hi> is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood alſo, all that which the Clerk ſhall gain by Unlawful Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, and otherwiſe Contrary to the <hi>Canons,</hi> a thing which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends Sufficiently, becauſe Unlawful Merchandize they call where the thing ſuch as it is bought, ſo it is ſold. And then by the <hi>Canons</hi> the Clergy-men are forbidden many kinds of Games in uſe, and many Services,<note place="margin">N. 254.</note> by which wayes there is gotten ſufficiently, ſo that hereby was return'd a great gain to the Chamber, and 'twould be a great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, if the <hi>Bulls</hi> could be Executed throughout half <hi>Italy,</hi> where they are not yet in Execution, and in <hi>France,</hi> and in <hi>Germany,</hi> and in other Kingdoms which have not yet received them; like as in the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of <hi>Castilia</hi> they make not Spoyles of all the Clergy-men, but of the Biſhops only, by the Laws of <hi>Carolus quintus,</hi> and of <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Canonists</hi> Defend the Right of the <hi>Spoyles</hi> with this Foundation, <hi>that the Pope is Patron or Maſter of all Eccleſiastical Incomes,</hi> and thoſe who ſpeak the moſt Modeſtly, ſay, Adminiſtrator; by which Doctrine there is alſo Introduced into <hi>Rome,</hi> that if any one hath unduly Uſurped to himſelf any Benefice, or otherwiſe ſhall have Robb'd the Church, if he agree with the Apoſtolick Chamber, to give a ſhare of it thereto, he may hold the Remainder with a good Conſcience,<note place="margin">N. 255.</note> and the Agreement being made and paid as much as was limited, let every one ſay, he is Abſolved of the reſt, and may hold it Lawfully as his own, becauſe the <hi>Pope</hi> is as hath been ſaid, either Maſter or Adminiſtrator General; and this they call Compounding with the <hi>Apostolick Chamber,</hi> which comes to be very largely Extended, ſo that thoſe who in Conſcience know, or at leaſtwiſe doubt of having ſomething not their own, and there is no —that either it is not known whom to Reſtore it, Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made.</p>
